SUICIDE CLUB</h2>
<h3>STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN WITH THE CREAM TARTS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">During</span> his residence in London, the
accomplished Prince Florizel of Bohemia gained the affection of
all classes by the seduction of his manner and by a
well-considered generosity.&nbsp; He was a remarkable man even by
what was known of him; and that was but a small part of what he
actually did.&nbsp; Although of a placid temper in ordinary
circumstances, and accustomed to take the world with as much
philosophy as any ploughman, the Prince of Bohemia was not
without a taste for ways of life more adventurous and eccentric
than that to which he was destined by his birth.&nbsp; Now and
then, when he fell into a low humour, when there was no laughable
play to witness in any of the London theatres, and when the
season of the year was unsuitable to those field sports in which
he excelled all competitors, he would summon his confidant and
Master of the Horse, Colonel Geraldine, and bid him prepare
himself against an evening ramble.&nbsp; The Master of the Horse
was a young officer of a brave and even temerarious
disposition.&nbsp; He greeted the news with delight, and hastened
to make ready.&nbsp; Long practice and a varied acquaintance of
life had given him a singular facility in disguise; he could
adapt not only his face and bearing, but his voice and almost his
thoughts, to those of any rank, character, or nation; and in this
way he diverted attention from the Prince, and sometimes gained
admission for the pair into strange societies.&nbsp; The civil
authorities were never taken into the secret of these adventures;
the imperturbable courage of the one and the ready invention and
chivalrous devotion of the other had brought them through a score
of dangerous passes; and they grew in confidence as time went
on.</p>
<p>One evening in March they were driven by a sharp fall of sleet
into an Oyster Bar in the immediate neighbourhood of Leicester
Square.&nbsp; Colonel Geraldine was dressed and painted to
represent a person connected with the Press in reduced
circumstances; while the Prince had, as usual, travestied his
appearance by the addition of false whiskers and a pair of large
adhesive eyebrows.&nbsp; These lent him a shaggy and
weather-beaten air, which, for one of his urbanity, formed the
most impenetrable disguise.&nbsp; Thus equipped, the commander
and his satellite sipped their brandy and soda in security.</p>
<p>The bar was full of guests, male and female; but though more
than one of these offered to fall into talk with our adventurers,
none of them promised to grow interesting upon a nearer
acquaintance.&nbsp; There was nothing present but the lees of
London and the commonplace of disrespectability; and the Prince
had already fallen to yawning, and was beginning to grow weary of
the whole excursion, when the swing doors were pushed violently
open, and a young man, followed by a couple of commissionaires,
entered the bar.&nbsp; Each of the commissionaires carried a
large dish of cream tarts under a cover, which they at once
removed; and the young man made the round of the company, and
pressed these confections upon every one&rsquo;s acceptance with
an exaggerated courtesy.&nbsp; Sometimes his offer was laughingly
accepted; sometimes it was firmly, or even harshly,
rejected.&nbsp; In these latter cases the new-comer always ate
the tart himself, with some more or less humorous commentary.</p>
<p>At last he accosted Prince Florizel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, with a profound obeisance,
proffering the tart at the same time between his thumb and
forefinger, &ldquo;will you so far honour an entire
stranger?&nbsp; I can answer for the quality of the pastry,
having eaten two dozen and three of them myself since five
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in the habit,&rdquo; replied the Prince, &ldquo;of
looking not so much to the nature of a gift as to the spirit in
which it is offered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The spirit, sir,&rdquo; returned the young man, with
another bow, &ldquo;is one of mockery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mockery?&rdquo; repeated Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;And
whom do you propose to mock?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not here to expound my philosophy,&rdquo; replied
the other, &ldquo;but to distribute these cream tarts.&nbsp; If I
mention that I heartily include myself in the ridicule of the
transaction, I hope you will consider honour satisfied and
condescend.&nbsp; If not, you will constrain me to eat my
twenty-eighth, and I own to being weary of the
exercise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You touch me,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;and I have
all the will in the world to rescue you from this dilemma, but
upon one condition.&nbsp; If my friend and I eat your
cakes&mdash;for which we have neither of us any natural
inclination&mdash;we shall expect you to join us at supper by way
of recompense.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man seemed to reflect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have still several dozen upon hand,&rdquo; he said at
last; &ldquo;and that will make it necessary for me to visit
several more bars before my great affair is concluded.&nbsp; This
will take some time; and if you are hungry&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince interrupted him with a polite gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My friend and I will accompany you,&rdquo; he said;
&ldquo;for we have already a deep interest in your very agreeable
mode of passing an evening.&nbsp; And now that the preliminaries
of peace are settled, allow me to sign the treaty for
both.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the Prince swallowed the tart with the best grace
imaginable.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is delicious,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive you are a connoisseur,&rdquo; replied the
young man.</p>
<p>Colonel Geraldine likewise did honour to the pastry; and every
one in that bar having now either accepted or refused his
delicacies, the young man with the cream tarts led the way to
another and similar establishment.&nbsp; The two commissionaires,
who seemed to have grown accustomed to their absurd employment,
followed immediately after; and the Prince and the Colonel
brought up the rear, arm in arm, and smiling to each other as
they went.&nbsp; In this order the company visited two other
taverns, where scenes were enacted of a like nature to that
already described&mdash;some refusing, some accepting, the
favours of this vagabond hospitality, and the young man himself
eating each rejected tart.</p>
<p>On leaving the third saloon the young man counted his
store.&nbsp; There were but nine remaining, three in one tray and
six in the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, addressing himself to his
two new followers, &ldquo;I am unwilling to delay your
supper.&nbsp; I am positively sure you must be hungry.&nbsp; I
feel that I owe you a special consideration.&nbsp; And on this
great day for me, when I am closing a career of folly by my most
conspicuously silly action, I wish to behave handsomely to all
who give me countenance.&nbsp; Gentlemen, you shall wait no
longer.&nbsp; Although my constitution is shattered by previous
excesses, at the risk of my life I liquidate the suspensory
condition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he crushed the nine remaining tarts into his
mouth, and swallowed them at a single movement each.&nbsp; Then,
turning to the commissionaires, he gave them a couple of
sovereigns.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have to thank you,&rdquo; said be, &ldquo;for your
extraordinary patience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he dismissed them with a bow apiece.&nbsp; For some
seconds he stood looking at the purse from which he had just paid
his assistants, then, with a laugh, he tossed it into the middle
of the street, and signified his readiness for supper.</p>
<p>In a small French restaurant in Soho, which had enjoyed an
exaggerated reputation for some little while, but had already
begun to be forgotten, and in a private room up two pair of
stairs, the three companions made a very elegant supper, and
drank three or four bottles of champagne, talking the while upon
indifferent subjects.&nbsp; The young man was fluent and gay, but
he laughed louder than was natural in a person of polite
breeding; his hands trembled violently, and his voice took sudden
and surprising inflections, which seemed to be independent of his
will.&nbsp; The dessert had been cleared away, and all three had
lighted their cigars, when the Prince addressed him in these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will, I am sure, pardon my curiosity.&nbsp; What I
have seen of you has greatly pleased but even more puzzled
me.&nbsp; And though I should be loth to seem indiscreet, I must
tell you that my friend and I are persons very well worthy to be
entrusted with a secret.&nbsp; We have many of our own, which we
are continually revealing to improper ears.&nbsp; And if, as I
suppose, your story is a silly one, you need have no delicacy
with us, who are two of the silliest men in England.&nbsp; My
name is Godall, Theophilus Godall; my friend is Major Alfred
Hammersmith&mdash;or at least, such is the name by which he
chooses to be known.&nbsp; We pass our lives entirely in the
search for extravagant adventures; and there is no extravagance
with which we are not capable of sympathy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like you, Mr. Godall,&rdquo; returned the young man;
&ldquo;you inspire me with a natural confidence; and I have not
the slightest objection to your friend the Major, whom I take to
be a nobleman in masquerade.&nbsp; At least, I am sure he is no
soldier.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel smiled at this compliment to the perfection of his
art; and the young man went on in a more animated manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is every reason why I should not tell you my
story.&nbsp; Perhaps that is just the reason why I am going to do
so.&nbsp; At least, you seem so well prepared to hear a tale of
silliness that I cannot find it in my heart to disappoint
you.&nbsp; My name, in spite of your example, I shall keep to
myself.&nbsp; My age is not essential to the narrative.&nbsp; I
am descended from my ancestors by ordinary generation, and from
them I inherited the very eligible human tenement which I still
occupy and a fortune of three hundred pounds a year.&nbsp; I
suppose they also handed on to me a hare-brain humour, which it
has been my chief delight to indulge.&nbsp; I received a good
education.&nbsp; I can play the violin nearly well enough to earn
money in the orchestra of a penny gaff, but not quite.&nbsp; The
same remark applies to the flute and the French horn.&nbsp; I
learned enough of whist to lose about a hundred a year at that
scientific game.&nbsp; My acquaintance with French was sufficient
to enable me to squander money in Paris with almost the same
facility as in London.&nbsp; In short, I am a person full of
manly accomplishments.&nbsp; I have had every sort of adventure,
including a duel about nothing.&nbsp; Only two months ago I met a
young lady exactly suited to my taste in mind and body; I found
my heart melt; I saw that I had come upon my fate at last, and
was in the way to fall in love.&nbsp; But when I came to reckon
up what remained to me of my capital, I found it amounted to
something less than four hundred pounds!&nbsp; I ask you
fairly&mdash;can a man who respects himself fall in love on four
hundred pounds?&nbsp; I concluded, certainly not; left the
presence of my charmer, and slightly accelerating my usual rate
of expenditure, came this morning to my last eighty pounds.&nbsp;
This I divided into two equal parts; forty I reserved for a
particular purpose; the remaining forty I was to dissipate before
the night.&nbsp; I have passed a very entertaining day, and
played many farces besides that of the cream tarts which procured
me the advantage of your acquaintance; for I was determined, as I
told you, to bring a foolish career to a still more foolish
conclusion; and when you saw me throw my purse into the street,
the forty pounds were at an end.&nbsp; Now you know me as well as
I know myself: a fool, but consistent in his folly; and, as I
will ask you to believe, neither a whimperer nor a
coward.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From the whole tone of the young man&rsquo;s statement it was
plain that he harboured very bitter and contemptuous thoughts
about himself.&nbsp; His auditors were led to imagine that his
love affair was nearer his heart than he admitted, and that he
had a design on his own life.&nbsp; The farce of the cream tarts
began to have very much the air of a tragedy in disguise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, is this not odd,&rdquo; broke out Geraldine,
giving a look to Prince Florizel, &ldquo;that we three fellows
should have met by the merest accident in so large a wilderness
as London, and should be so nearly in the same
condition?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; cried the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you,
too, ruined?&nbsp; Is this supper a folly like my cream
tarts?&nbsp; Has the devil brought three of his own together for
a last carouse?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil, depend upon it, can sometimes do a very
gentlemanly thing,&rdquo; returned Prince Florizel; &ldquo;and I
am so much touched by this coincidence, that, although we are not
entirely in the same case, I am going to put an end to the
disparity.&nbsp; Let your heroic treatment of the last cream
tarts be my example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the Prince drew out his purse and took from it a
small bundle of bank-notes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see, I was a week or so behind you, but I mean to
catch you up and come neck and neck into the winning-post,&rdquo;
he continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;This,&rdquo; laying one of the notes
upon the table, &ldquo;will suffice for the bill.&nbsp; As for
the rest&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He tossed them into the fire, and they went up the chimney in
a single blaze.</p>
<p>The young man tried to catch his arm, but as the table was
between them his interference came too late.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Unhappy man,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you should not
have burned them all!&nbsp; You should have kept forty
pounds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Forty pounds!&rdquo; repeated the Prince.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Why, in heaven&rsquo;s name, forty pounds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why not eighty?&rdquo; cried the Colonel; &ldquo;for to
my certain knowledge there must have been a hundred in the
bundle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was only forty pounds he needed,&rdquo; said the
young man gloomily.&nbsp; &ldquo;But without them there is no
admission.&nbsp; The rule is strict.&nbsp; Forty pounds for
each.&nbsp; Accursed life, where a man cannot even die without
money!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince and the Colonel exchanged glances. &ldquo;Explain
yourself,&rdquo; said the latter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have still a
pocket-book tolerably well lined, and I need not say how readily
I should share my wealth with Godall.&nbsp; But I must know to
what end: you must certainly tell us what you mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man seemed to awaken; he looked uneasily from one to
the other, and his face flushed deeply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are not fooling me?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are indeed ruined men like me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I am for my part,&rdquo; replied the
Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And for mine,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;I have
given you proof.&nbsp; Who but a ruined man would throw his notes
into the fire?&nbsp; The action speaks for itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A ruined man&mdash;yes,&rdquo; returned the other
suspiciously, &ldquo;or else a millionaire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough, sir,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;I have said
so, and I am not accustomed to have my word remain in
doubt.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ruined?&rdquo; said the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you
ruined, like me?&nbsp; Are you, after a life of indulgence, come
to such a pass that you can only indulge yourself in one thing
more?&nbsp; Are you&rdquo;&mdash;he kept lowering his voice as he
went on&mdash;&ldquo;are you going to give yourselves that last
indulgence?&nbsp; Are you going to avoid the consequences of your
folly by the one infallible and easy path?&nbsp; Are you going to
give the slip to the sheriff&rsquo;s officers of conscience by
the one open door?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Suddenly he broke off and attempted to laugh.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is your health!&rdquo; he cried, emptying his
glass, &ldquo;and good night to you, my merry ruined
men.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Geraldine caught him by the arm as he was about to
rise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You lack confidence in us,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and
you are wrong.&nbsp; To all your questions I make answer in the
affirmative.&nbsp; But I am not so timid, and can speak the
Queen&rsquo;s English plainly.&nbsp; We too, like yourself, have
had enough of life, and are determined to die.&nbsp; Sooner or
later, alone or together, we meant to seek out death and beard
him where he lies ready.&nbsp; Since we have met you, and your
case is more pressing, let it be to-night&mdash;and at
once&mdash;and, if you will, all three together.&nbsp; Such a
penniless trio,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;should go arm in arm into
the halls of Pluto, and give each other some countenance among
the shades!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geraldine had hit exactly on the manners and intonations that
became the part he was playing.&nbsp; The Prince himself was
disturbed, and looked over at his confidant with a shade of
doubt.&nbsp; As for the young man, the flush came back darkly
into his cheek, and his eyes threw out a spark of light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the men for me!&rdquo; he cried, with an almost
terrible gaiety.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shake hands upon the
bargain!&rdquo; (his hand was cold and wet).&nbsp; &ldquo;You
little know in what a company you will begin the march!&nbsp; You
little know in what a happy moment for yourselves you partook of
my cream tarts!&nbsp; I am only a unit, but I am a unit in an
army.&nbsp; I know Death&rsquo;s private door.&nbsp; I am one of
his familiars, and can show you into eternity without ceremony
and yet without scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>They called upon him eagerly to explain his meaning.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you muster eighty pounds between you?&rdquo; he
demanded.</p>
<p>Geraldine ostentatiously consulted his pocket-book, and
replied in the affirmative.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fortunate beings!&rdquo; cried the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Forty pounds is the entry money of the Suicide
Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Suicide Club,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;why,
what the devil is that?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; said the young man; &ldquo;this is the
age of conveniences, and I have to tell you of the last
perfection of the sort.&nbsp; We have affairs in different
places; and hence railways were invented.&nbsp; Railways
separated us infallibly from our friends; and so telegraphs were
made that we might communicate speedier at great distances.&nbsp;
Even in hotels we have lifts to spare us a climb of some hundred
steps.&nbsp; Now, we know that life is only a stage to play the
fool upon as long as the part amuses us.&nbsp; There was one more
convenience lacking to modern comfort; a decent, easy way to quit
that stage; the back stairs to liberty; or, as I said this
moment, Death&rsquo;s private door.&nbsp; This, my two
fellow-rebels, is supplied by the Suicide Club.&nbsp; Do not
suppose that you and I are alone, or even exceptional in the
highly reasonable desire that we profess.&nbsp; A large number of
our fellowmen, who have grown heartily sick of the performance in
which they are expected to join daily and all their lives long,
are only kept from flight by one or two considerations.&nbsp;
Some have families who would be shocked, or even blamed, if the
matter became public; others have a weakness at heart and recoil
from the circumstances of death.&nbsp; That is, to some extent,
my own experience.&nbsp; I cannot put a pistol to my head and
draw the trigger; for something stronger than myself withholds
the act; and although I loathe life, I have not strength enough
in my body to take hold of death and be done with it.&nbsp; For
such as I, and for all who desire to be out of the coil without
posthumous scandal, the Suicide Club has been inaugurated.&nbsp;
How this has been managed, what is its history, or what may be
its ramifications in other lands, I am myself uninformed; and
what I know of its constitution, I am not at liberty to
communicate to you.&nbsp; To this extent, however, I am at your
service.&nbsp; If you are truly tired of life, I will introduce
you to-night to a meeting; and if not to-night, at least some
time within the week, you will be easily relieved of your
existences.&nbsp; It is now (consulting his watch) eleven; by
half-past, at latest, we must leave this place; so that you have
half-an-hour before you to consider my proposal.&nbsp; It is more
serious than a cream tart,&rdquo; he added, with a smile;
&ldquo;and I suspect more palatable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;More serious, certainly,&rdquo; returned Colonel
Geraldine; &ldquo;and as it is so much more so, will you allow me
five minutes&rsquo; speech in private with my friend, Mr.
Godall?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is only fair,&rdquo; answered the young man.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If you will permit, I will retire.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very obliging,&rdquo; said the Colonel.</p>
<p>As soon as the two were alone&mdash;&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said
Prince Florizel, &ldquo;is the use of this confabulation,
Geraldine?&nbsp; I see you are flurried, whereas my mind is very
tranquilly made up.&nbsp; I will see the end of this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; said the Colonel, turning pale;
&ldquo;let me ask you to consider the importance of your life,
not only to your friends, but to the public interest.&nbsp;
&lsquo;If not to-night,&rsquo; said this madman; but supposing
that to-night some irreparable disaster were to overtake your
Highness&rsquo;s person, what, let me ask you, what would be my
despair, and what the concern and disaster of a great
nation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will see the end of this,&rdquo; repeated the Prince
in his most deliberate tones; &ldquo;and have the kindness,
Colonel Geraldine, to remember and respect your word of honour as
a gentleman.&nbsp; Under no circumstances, recollect, nor without
my special authority, are you to betray the incognito under which
I choose to go abroad.&nbsp; These were my commands, which I now
reiterate.&nbsp; And now,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;let me ask you
to call for the bill.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Geraldine bowed in submission; but he had a very white
face as he summoned the young man of the cream tarts, and issued
his directions to the waiter.&nbsp; The Prince preserved his
undisturbed demeanour, and described a Palais Royal farce to the
young suicide with great humour and gusto.&nbsp; He avoided the
Colonel&rsquo;s appealing looks without ostentation, and selected
another cheroot with more than usual care.&nbsp; Indeed, he was
now the only man of the party who kept any command over his
nerves.</p>
<p>The bill was discharged, the Prince giving the whole change of
the note to the astonished waiter; and the three drove off in a
four-wheeler.&nbsp; They were not long upon the way before the
cab stopped at the entrance to a rather dark court.&nbsp; Here
all descended.</p>
<p>After Geraldine had paid the fare, the young man turned, and
addressed Prince Florizel as follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is still time, Mr. Godall, to make good your escape
into thraldom.&nbsp; And for you too, Major Hammersmith.&nbsp;
Reflect well before you take another step; and if your hearts say
no&mdash;here are the cross-roads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Lead on, sir,&rdquo; said the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
not the man to go back from a thing once said.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your coolness does me good,&rdquo; replied their
guide.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never seen any one so unmoved at this
conjuncture; and yet you are not the first whom I have escorted
to this door.&nbsp; More than one of my friends has preceded me,
where I knew I must shortly follow.&nbsp; But this is of no
interest to you.&nbsp; Wait me here for only a few moments; I
shall return as soon as I have arranged the preliminaries of your
introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the young man, waving his hand to his
companions, turned into the court, entered a doorway and
disappeared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of all our follies,&rdquo; said Colonel Geraldine in a
low voice, &ldquo;this is the wildest and most
dangerous.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perfectly believe so,&rdquo; returned the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have still,&rdquo; pursued the Colonel, &ldquo;a
moment to ourselves.&nbsp; Let me beseech your Highness to profit
by the opportunity and retire.&nbsp; The consequences of this
step are so dark, and may be so grave, that I feel myself
justified in pushing a little farther than usual the liberty
which your Highness is so condescending as to allow me in
private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Am I to understand that Colonel Geraldine is
afraid?&rdquo; asked his Highness, taking his cheroot from his
lips, and looking keenly into the other&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My fear is certainly not personal,&rdquo; replied the
other proudly; &ldquo;of that your Highness may rest well
assured.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had supposed as much,&rdquo; returned the Prince,
with undisturbed good humour; &ldquo;but I was unwilling to
remind you of the difference in our stations.&nbsp; No
more&mdash;no more,&rdquo; he added, seeing Geraldine about to
apologise, &ldquo;you stand excused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he smoked placidly, leaning against a railing, until the
young man returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;has our reception been
arranged?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Follow me,&rdquo; was the reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
President will see you in the cabinet.&nbsp; And let me warn you
to be frank in your answers.&nbsp; I have stood your guarantee;
but the club requires a searching inquiry before admission; for
the indiscretion of a single member would lead to the dispersion
of the whole society for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince and Geraldine put their heads together for a
moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;Bear me out in this,&rdquo; said the one;
and &ldquo;bear me out in that,&rdquo; said the other; and by
boldly taking up the characters of men with whom both were
acquainted, they had come to an agreement in a twinkling, and
were ready to follow their guide into the President&rsquo;s
cabinet.</p>
<p>There were no formidable obstacles to pass.&nbsp; The outer
door stood open; the door of the cabinet was ajar; and there, in
a small but very high apartment, the young man left them once
more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He will be here immediately,&rdquo; he said, with a
nod, as he disappeared.</p>
<p>Voices were audible in the cabinet through the folding doors
which formed one end; and now and then the noise of a champagne
cork, followed by a burst of laughter, intervened among the
sounds of conversation.&nbsp; A single tall window looked out
upon the river and the embankment; and by the disposition of the
lights they judged themselves not far from Charing Cross
station.&nbsp; The furniture was scanty, and the coverings worn
to the thread; and there was nothing movable except a hand-bell
in the centre of a round table, and the hats and coats of a
considerable party hung round the wall on pegs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What sort of a den is this?&rdquo; said Geraldine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is what I have come to see,&rdquo; replied the
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;If they keep live devils on the premises,
the thing may grow amusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then the folding door was opened no more than was
necessary for the passage of a human body; and there entered at
the same moment a louder buzz of talk, and the redoubtable
President of the Suicide Club.&nbsp; The President was a man of
fifty or upwards; large and rambling in his gait, with shaggy
side whiskers, a bald top to his head, and a veiled grey eye,
which now and then emitted a twinkle.&nbsp; His mouth, which
embraced a large cigar, he kept continually screwing round and
round and from side to side, as he looked sagaciously and coldly
at the strangers.&nbsp; He was dressed in light tweeds, with his
neck very open in a striped shirt collar; and carried a minute
book under one arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said he, after he had closed the
door behind him.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am told you wish to speak with
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have a desire, sir, to join the Suicide Club,&rdquo;
replied the Colonel.</p>
<p>The President rolled his cigar about in his mouth.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; he said abruptly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; returned the Colonel, &ldquo;but I
believe you are the person best qualified to give us information
on that point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I?&rdquo; cried the President.&nbsp; &ldquo;A Suicide
Club?&nbsp; Come, come! this is a frolic for All Fools&rsquo;
Day.&nbsp; I can make allowances for gentlemen who get merry in
their liquor; but let there be an end to this.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Call your Club what you will,&rdquo; said the Colonel,
&ldquo;you have some company behind these doors, and we insist on
joining it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; returned the President curtly, &ldquo;you
have made a mistake.&nbsp; This is a private house, and you must
leave it instantly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince had remained quietly in his seat throughout this
little colloquy; but now, when the Colonel looked over to him, as
much as to say, &ldquo;Take your answer and come away, for
God&rsquo;s sake!&rdquo; he drew his cheroot from his mouth, and
spoke&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come here,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;upon the
invitation of a friend of yours.&nbsp; He has doubtless informed
you of my intention in thus intruding on your party.&nbsp; Let me
remind you that a person in my circumstances has exceedingly
little to bind him, and is not at all likely to tolerate much
rudeness.&nbsp; I am a very quiet man, as a usual thing; but, my
dear sir, you are either going to oblige me in the little matter
of which you are aware, or you shall very bitterly repent that
you ever admitted me to your ante-chamber.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President laughed aloud.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the way to speak,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You are a man who is a man.&nbsp; You know the way to my
heart, and can do what you like with me.&nbsp; Will you,&rdquo;
he continued, addressing Geraldine, &ldquo;will you step aside
for a few minutes?&nbsp; I shall finish first with your
companion, and some of the club&rsquo;s formalities require to be
fulfilled in private.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words he opened the door of a small closet, into
which he shut the Colonel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe in you,&rdquo; he said to Florizel, as soon
as they were alone; &ldquo;but are you sure of your
friend?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so sure as I am of myself, though he has more
cogent reasons,&rdquo; answered Florizel, &ldquo;but sure enough
to bring him here without alarm.&nbsp; He has had enough to cure
the most tenacious man of life.&nbsp; He was cashiered the other
day for cheating at cards.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A good reason, I daresay,&rdquo; replied the President;
&ldquo;at least, we have another in the same case, and I feel
sure of him.&nbsp; Have you also been in the Service, may I
ask?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;but I was too
lazy, I left it early.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your reason for being tired of life?&rdquo;
pursued the President.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The same, as near as I can make out,&rdquo; answered
the Prince; &ldquo;unadulterated laziness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President started.&nbsp; &ldquo;D&mdash;n it,&rdquo; said
he, &ldquo;you must have something better than that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have no more money,&rdquo; added Florizel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is also a vexation, without doubt.&nbsp; It brings my
sense of idleness to an acute point.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President rolled his cigar round in his mouth for some
seconds, directing his gaze straight into the eyes of this
unusual neophyte; but the Prince supported his scrutiny with
unabashed good temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I had not a deal of experience,&rdquo; said the
President at last, &ldquo;I should turn you off.&nbsp; But I know
the world; and this much any way, that the most frivolous excuses
for a suicide are often the toughest to stand by.&nbsp; And when
I downright like a man, as I do you, sir, I would rather strain
the regulation than deny him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince and the Colonel, one after the other, were
subjected to a long and particular interrogatory: the Prince
alone; but Geraldine in the presence of the Prince, so that the
President might observe the countenance of the one while the
other was being warmly cross-examined.&nbsp; The result was
satisfactory; and the President, after having booked a few
details of each case, produced a form of oath to be
accepted.&nbsp; Nothing could be conceived more passive than the
obedience promised, or more stringent than the terms by which the
juror bound himself.&nbsp; The man who forfeited a pledge so
awful could scarcely have a rag of honour or any of the
consolations of religion left to him.&nbsp; Florizel signed the
document, but not without a shudder; the Colonel followed his
example with an air of great depression.&nbsp; Then the President
received the entry money; and without more ado, introduced the
two friends into the smoking-room of the Suicide Club.</p>
<p>The smoking-room of the Suicide Club was the same height as
the cabinet into which it opened, but much larger, and papered
from top to bottom with an imitation of oak wainscot.&nbsp; A
large and cheerful fire and a number of gas-jets illuminated the
company.&nbsp; The Prince and his follower made the number up to
eighteen.&nbsp; Most of the party were smoking, and drinking
champagne; a feverish hilarity reigned, with sudden and rather
ghastly pauses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is this a full meeting?&rdquo; asked the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Middling,&rdquo; said the President.&nbsp; &ldquo;By
the way,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if you have any money, it is
usual to offer some champagne.&nbsp; It keeps up a good spirit,
and is one of my own little perquisites.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hammersmith,&rdquo; said Florizel, &ldquo;I may leave
the champagne to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he turned away and began to go round among the
guests.&nbsp; Accustomed to play the host in the highest circles,
he charmed and dominated all whom he approached; there was
something at once winning and authoritative in his address; and
his extraordinary coolness gave him yet another distinction in
this half maniacal society.&nbsp; As he went from one to another
he kept both his eyes and ears open, and soon began to gain a
general idea of the people among whom he found himself.&nbsp; As
in all other places of resort, one type predominated: people in
the prime of youth, with every show of intelligence and
sensibility in their appearance, but with little promise of
strength or the quality that makes success.&nbsp; Few were much
above thirty, and not a few were still in their teens.&nbsp; They
stood, leaning on tables and shifting on their feet; sometimes
they smoked extraordinarily fast, and sometimes they let their
cigars go out; some talked well, but the conversation of others
was plainly the result of nervous tension, and was equally
without wit or purport.&nbsp; As each new bottle of champagne was
opened, there was a manifest improvement in gaiety.&nbsp; Only
two were seated&mdash;one in a chair in the recess of the window,
with his head hanging and his hands plunged deep into his trouser
pockets, pale, visibly moist with perspiration, saying never a
word, a very wreck of soul and body; the other sat on the divan
close by the chimney, and attracted notice by a trenchant
dissimilarity from all the rest.&nbsp; He was probably upwards of
forty, but he looked fully ten years older; and Florizel thought
he had never seen a man more naturally hideous, nor one more
ravaged by disease and ruinous excitements.&nbsp; He was no more
than skin and bone, was partly paralysed, and wore spectacles of
such unusual power, that his eyes appeared through the glasses
greatly magnified and distorted in shape.&nbsp; Except the Prince
and the President, he was the only person in the room who
preserved the composure of ordinary life.</p>
<p>There was little decency among the members of the club.&nbsp;
Some boasted of the disgraceful actions, the consequences of
which had reduced them to seek refuge in death; and the others
listened without disapproval.&nbsp; There was a tacit
understanding against moral judgments; and whoever passed the
club doors enjoyed already some of the immunities of the
tomb.&nbsp; They drank to each other&rsquo;s memories, and to
those of notable suicides in the past.&nbsp; They compared and
developed their different views of death&mdash;some declaring
that it was no more than blackness and cessation; others full of
a hope that that very night they should be scaling the stars and
commencing with the mighty dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To the eternal memory of Baron Trenck, the type of
suicides!&rdquo; cried one.&nbsp; &ldquo;He went out of a small
cell into a smaller, that he might come forth again to
freedom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For my part,&rdquo; said a second, &ldquo;I wish no
more than a bandage for my eyes and cotton for my ears.&nbsp;
Only they have no cotton thick enough in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A third was for reading the mysteries of life in a future
state; and a fourth professed that he would never have joined the
club, if he had not been induced to believe in Mr. Darwin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I could not bear,&rdquo; said this remarkable suicide,
&ldquo;to be descended from an ape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Altogether, the Prince was disappointed by the bearing and
conversation of the members.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not seem to me,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;a
matter for so much disturbance.&nbsp; If a man has made up his
mind to kill himself, let him do it, in God&rsquo;s name, like a
gentleman.&nbsp; This flutter and big talk is out of
place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the meanwhile Colonel Geraldine was a prey to the blackest
apprehensions; the club and its rules were still a mystery, and
he looked round the room for some one who should be able to set
his mind at rest.&nbsp; In this survey his eye lighted on the
paralytic person with the strong spectacles; and seeing him so
exceedingly tranquil, he besought the President, who was going in
and out of the room under a pressure of business, to present him
to the gentleman on the divan.</p>
<p>The functionary explained the needlessness of all such
formalities within the club, but nevertheless presented Mr.
Hammersmith to Mr. Malthus.</p>
<p>Mr. Malthus looked at the Colonel curiously, and then
requested him to take a seat upon his right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a new-comer,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and wish
information?&nbsp; You have come to the proper source.&nbsp; It
is two years since I first visited this charming club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel breathed again.&nbsp; If Mr. Malthus had
frequented the place for two years there could be little danger
for the Prince in a single evening.&nbsp; But Geraldine was none
the less astonished, and began to suspect a mystification.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;two years!&nbsp; I
thought&mdash;but indeed I see I have been made the subject of a
pleasantry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied Mr. Malthus mildly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My case is peculiar.&nbsp; I am not, properly speaking, a
suicide at all; but, as it were, an honorary member.&nbsp; I
rarely visit the club twice in two months.&nbsp; My infirmity and
the kindness of the President have procured me these little
immunities, for which besides I pay at an advanced rate.&nbsp;
Even as it is my luck has been extraordinary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;that I
must ask you to be more explicit.&nbsp; You must remember that I
am still most imperfectly acquainted with the rules of the
club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An ordinary member who comes here in search of death
like yourself,&rdquo; replied the paralytic, &ldquo;returns every
evening until fortune favours him.&nbsp; He can even, if he is
penniless, get board and lodging from the President: very fair, I
believe, and clean, although, of course, not luxurious; that
could hardly be, considering the exiguity (if I may so express
myself) of the subscription.&nbsp; And then the President&rsquo;s
company is a delicacy in itself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; cried Geraldine, &ldquo;he had not
greatly prepossessed me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Malthus, &ldquo;you do not know the
man: the drollest fellow!&nbsp; What stories!&nbsp; What
cynicism!&nbsp; He knows life to admiration and, between
ourselves, is probably the most corrupt rogue in
Christendom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And he also,&rdquo; asked the Colonel, &ldquo;is a
permanency&mdash;like yourself, if I may say so without
offence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, he is a permanency in a very different sense
from me,&rdquo; replied Mr. Malthus.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have hem
graciously spared, but I must go at last.&nbsp; Now he never
plays.&nbsp; He shuffles and deals for the club, and makes the
necessary arrangements.&nbsp; That man, my dear Mr. Hammersmith,
is the very soul of ingenuity.&nbsp; For three years he has
pursued in London his useful and, I think I may add, his artistic
calling; and not so much as a whisper of suspicion has been once
aroused.&nbsp; I believe him myself to be inspired.&nbsp; You
doubtless remember the celebrated case, six months ago, of the
gentleman who was accidentally poisoned in a chemists shop?&nbsp;
That was one of the least rich, one of the least racy, of his
notions; but then, how simple! and how safe!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You astound me,&rdquo; said the Colonel.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Was that unfortunate gentleman one of
the&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; He was about to say
&ldquo;victims&rdquo;; but bethinking himself in time, he
substituted&mdash;&ldquo;members of the club?&rdquo;</p>
<p>In the same flash of thought, it occurred to him that Mr.
Malthus himself had not at all spoken in the tone of one who is
in love with death; and he added hurriedly:</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I perceive I am still in the dark.&nbsp; You speak
of shuffling and dealing; pray for what end?&nbsp; And since you
seem rather unwilling to die than otherwise, I must own that I
cannot conceive what brings you here at all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You say truly that you are in the dark,&rdquo; replied
Mr. Malthus with more animation.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, my dear sir,
this club is the temple of intoxication.&nbsp; If my enfeebled
health could support the excitement more often, you may depend
upon it I should be more often here.&nbsp; It requires all the
sense of duty engendered by a long habit of ill-health and
careful regimen, to keep me from excess in this, which is, I may
say, my last dissipation.&nbsp; I have tried them all,
sir,&rdquo; he went on, laying his hand on Geraldine&rsquo;s arm,
&ldquo;all without exception, and I declare to you, upon my
honour, there is not one of them that has not been grossly and
untruthfully overrated.&nbsp; People trifle with love.&nbsp; Now,
I deny that love is a strong passion.&nbsp; Fear is the strong
passion; it is with fear that you must trifle, if you wish to
taste the intensest joys of living.&nbsp; Envy me&mdash;envy me,
sir,&rdquo; he added with a chuckle, &ldquo;I am a
coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Geraldine could scarcely repress a movement of repulsion for
this deplorable wretch; but he commanded himself with an effort,
and continued his inquiries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, sir,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;is the excitement so
artfully prolonged? and where is there any element of
uncertainty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must tell you how the victim for every evening is
selected,&rdquo; returned Mr. Malthus; &ldquo;and not only the
victim, but another member, who is to be the instrument in the
club&rsquo;s hands, and death&rsquo;s high priest for that
occasion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;do they then
kill each other?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trouble of suicide is removed in that way,&rdquo;
returned Malthus with a nod.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Merciful heavens!&rdquo; ejaculated the Colonel,
&ldquo;and may you&mdash;may I&mdash;may the&mdash;my friend I
mean&mdash;may any of us be pitched upon this evening as the
slayer of another man&rsquo;s body and immortal spirit?&nbsp; Can
such things be possible among men born of women?&nbsp; Oh! infamy
of infamies!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was about to rise in his horror, when he caught the
Prince&rsquo;s eye.&nbsp; It was fixed upon him from across the
room with a frowning and angry stare.&nbsp; And in a moment
Geraldine recovered his composure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;why not?&nbsp; And
since you say the game is interesting, <i>vogue la
gal&egrave;re</i>&mdash;I follow the club!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Malthus had keenly enjoyed the Colonel&rsquo;s amazement
and disgust.&nbsp; He had the vanity of wickedness; and it
pleased him to see another man give way to a generous movement,
while he felt himself, in his entire corruption, superior to such
emotions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You now, after your first moment of surprise,&rdquo;
said he, &ldquo;are in a position to appreciate the delights of
our society.&nbsp; You can see how it combines the excitement of
a gaming-table, a duel, and a Roman amphitheatre.&nbsp; The
Pagans did well enough; I cordially admire the refinement of
their minds; but it has been reserved for a Christian country to
attain this extreme, this quintessence, this absolute of
poignancy.&nbsp; You will understand how vapid are all amusements
to a man who has acquired a taste for this one.&nbsp; The game we
play,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;is one of extreme
simplicity.&nbsp; A full pack&mdash;but I perceive you are about
to see the thing in progress.&nbsp; Will you lend me the help of
your arm?&nbsp; I am unfortunately paralysed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Indeed, just as Mr. Malthus was beginning his description,
another pair of folding-doors was thrown open, and the whole club
began to pass, not without some hurry, into the adjoining
room.&nbsp; It was similar in every respect to the one from which
it was entered, but somewhat differently furnished.&nbsp; The
centre was occupied by a long green table, at which the President
sat shuffling a pack of cards with great particularity.&nbsp;
Even with the stick and the Colonel&rsquo;s arm, Mr. Malthus
walked with so much difficulty that every one was seated before
this pair and the Prince, who had waited for them, entered the
apartment; and, in consequence, the three took seats close
together at the lower end of the board.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a pack of fifty-two,&rdquo; whispered Mr.
Malthus.&nbsp; &ldquo;Watch for the ace of spades, which is the
sign of death, and the ace of clubs, which designates the
official of the night.&nbsp; Happy, happy young men!&rdquo; he
added.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have good eyes, and can follow the
game.&nbsp; Alas!&nbsp; I cannot tell an ace from a deuce across
the table.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he proceeded to equip himself with a second pair of
spectacles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must at least watch the faces,&rdquo; he
explained.</p>
<p>The Colonel rapidly informed his friend of all that he had
learned from the honorary member, and of the horrible alternative
that lay before them.&nbsp; The Prince was conscious of a deadly
chill and a contraction about his heart; he swallowed with
difficulty, and looked from side to side like a man in a
maze.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One bold stroke,&rdquo; whispered the Colonel,
&ldquo;and we may still escape.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the suggestion recalled the Prince&rsquo;s spirits.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said be.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me see that
you can play like a gentleman for any stake, however
serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he looked about him, once more to all appearance at his
ease, although his heart beat thickly, and he was conscious of an
unpleasant heat in his bosom.&nbsp; The members were all very
quiet and intent; every one was pale, but none so pale as Mr.
Malthus.&nbsp; His eyes protruded; his head kept nodding
involuntarily upon his spine; his hands found their way, one
after the other, to his mouth, where they made clutches at his
tremulous and ashen lips.&nbsp; It was plain that the honorary
member enjoyed his membership on very startling terms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention, gentlemen!&rdquo; said the President.</p>
<p>And he began slowly dealing the cards about the table in the
reverse direction, pausing until each man had shown his
card.&nbsp; Nearly every one hesitated; and sometimes you would
see a player&rsquo;s fingers stumble more than once before he
could turn over the momentous slip of pasteboard.&nbsp; As the
Prince&rsquo;s turn drew nearer, he was conscious of a growing
and almost suffocating excitement; but he had somewhat of the
gambler&rsquo;s nature, and recognised almost with astonishment,
that there was a degree of pleasure in his sensations.&nbsp; The
nine of clubs fell to his lot; the three of spades was dealt to
Geraldine; and the queen of hearts to Mr. Malthus, who was unable
to suppress a sob of relief.&nbsp; The young man of the cream
tarts almost immediately afterwards turned over the ace of clubs,
and remained frozen with horror, the card still resting on his
finger; he had not come there to kill, but to be killed; and the
Prince in his generous sympathy with his position almost forgot
the peril that still hung over himself and his friend.</p>
<p>The deal was coming round again, and still Death&rsquo;s card
had not come out.&nbsp; The players held their respiration, and
only breathed by gasps.&nbsp; The Prince received another club;
Geraldine had a diamond; but when Mr. Malthus turned up his card
a horrible noise, like that of something breaking, issued from
his mouth; and he rose from his seat and sat down again, with no
sign of his paralysis.&nbsp; It was the ace of spades.&nbsp; The
honorary member had trifled once too often with his terrors.</p>
<p>Conversation broke out again almost at once.&nbsp; The players
relaxed their rigid attitudes, and began to rise from the table
and stroll back by twos and threes into the smoking-room.&nbsp;
The President stretched his arms and yawned, like a man who has
finished his day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; But Mr. Malthus sat in his
place, with his head in his hands, and his hands upon the table,
drunk and motionless&mdash;a thing stricken down.</p>
<p>The Prince and Geraldine made their escape at once.&nbsp; In
the cold night air their horror of what they had witnessed was
redoubled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried the Prince, &ldquo;to be bound by an
oath in such a matter! to allow this wholesale trade in murder to
be continued with profit and impunity!&nbsp; If I but dared to
forfeit my pledge!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is impossible for your Highness,&rdquo; replied
the Colonel, &ldquo;whose honour is the honour of Bohemia.&nbsp;
But I dare, and may with propriety, forfeit mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geraldine,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;if your
honour suffers in any of the adventures into which you follow me,
not only will I never pardon you, but&mdash;what I believe will
much more sensibly affect you&mdash;I should never forgive
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I receive your Highness&rsquo;s commands,&rdquo;
replied the Colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shall we go from this accursed
spot?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;Call a cab in
Heaven&rsquo;s name, and let me try to forget in slumber the
memory of this night&rsquo;s disgrace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But it was notable that he carefully read the name of the
court before he left it.</p>
<p>The next morning, as soon as the Prince was stirring, Colonel
Geraldine brought him a daily newspaper, with the following
paragraph marked:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Melancholy
Accident</span>.&mdash;This morning, about two o&rsquo;clock, Mr.
Bartholomew Malthus, of 16 Chepstow Place, Westbourne Grove, on
his way home from a party at a friend&rsquo;s house, fell over
the upper parapet in Trafalgar Square, fracturing his skull and
breaking a leg and an arm.&nbsp; Death was instantaneous.&nbsp;
Mr. Malthus, accompanied by a friend, was engaged in looking for
a cab at the time of the unfortunate occurrence.&nbsp; As Mr.
Malthus was paralytic, it is thought that his fall may have been
occasioned by another seizure.&nbsp; The unhappy gentleman was
well known in the most respectable circles, and his loss will be
widely and deeply deplored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If ever a soul went straight to Hell,&rdquo; said
Geraldine solemnly, &ldquo;it was that paralytic
man&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince buried his face in his hands, and remained
silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am almost rejoiced,&rdquo; continued the Colonel,
&ldquo;to know that he is dead.&nbsp; But for our young man of
the cream tarts I confess my heart bleeds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geraldine,&rdquo; said the Prince, raising his face,
&ldquo;that unhappy lad was last night as innocent as you and I;
and this morning the guilt of blood is on his soul.&nbsp; When I
think of the President, my heart grows sick within me.&nbsp; I do
not know how it shall be done, but I shall have that scoundrel at
my mercy as there is a God in heaven.&nbsp; What an experience,
what a lesson, was that game of cards!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said the Colonel, &ldquo;never to be
repeated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince remained so long without replying, that Geraldine
grew alarmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot mean to return,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have suffered too much and seen too much horror
already.&nbsp; The duties of your high position forbid the
repetition of the hazard.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is much in what you say,&rdquo; replied Prince
Florizel, &ldquo;and I am not altogether pleased with my own
determination.&nbsp; Alas! in the clothes of the greatest
potentate, what is there but a man?&nbsp; I never felt my
weakness more acutely than now, Geraldine, but it is stronger
than I.&nbsp; Can I cease to interest myself in the fortunes of
the unhappy young man who supped with us some hours ago?&nbsp;
Can I leave the President to follow his nefarious career
unwatched?&nbsp; Can I begin an adventure so entrancing, and not
follow it to an end?&nbsp; No, Geraldine: you ask of the Prince
more than the man is able to perform.&nbsp; To-night, once more,
we take our places at the table of the Suicide Club.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Colonel Geraldine fell upon his knees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your Highness take my life?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is his&mdash;his freely; but do not, O do not! let him
ask me to countenance so terrible a risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Geraldine,&rdquo; replied the Prince, with some
haughtiness of manner, &ldquo;your life is absolutely your
own.&nbsp; I only looked for obedience; and when that is
unwillingly rendered, I shall look for that no longer.&nbsp; I
add one word your: importunity in this affair has been
sufficient.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Master of the Horse regained his feet at once.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;may I be excused
in my attendance this afternoon?&nbsp; I dare not, as an
honourable man, venture a second time into that fatal house until
I have perfectly ordered my affairs.&nbsp; Your Highness shall
meet, I promise him, with no more opposition from the most
devoted and grateful of his servants.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear Geraldine,&rdquo; returned Prince Florizel,
&ldquo;I always regret when you oblige me to remember my
rank.&nbsp; Dispose of your day as you think fit, but be here
before eleven in the same disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The club, on this second evening, was not so fully attended;
and when Geraldine and the Prince arrived, there were not above
half-a-dozen persons in the smoking-room.&nbsp; His Highness took
the President aside and congratulated him warmly on the demise of
Mr. Malthus.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I like,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to meet with capacity,
and certainly find much of it in you.&nbsp; Your profession is of
a very delicate nature, but I see you are well qualified to
conduct it with success and secrecy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President was somewhat affected by these compliments from
one of his Highness&rsquo;s superior bearing.&nbsp; He
acknowledged them almost with humility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor Malthy!&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I shall hardly
know the club without him.&nbsp; The most of my patrons are boys,
sir, and poetical boys, who are not much company for me.&nbsp;
Not but what Malthy had some poetry, too; but it was of a kind
that I could understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I can readily imagine you should find yourself in
sympathy with Mr. Malthus,&rdquo; returned the Prince.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He struck me as a man of a very original
disposition.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young man of the cream tarts was in the room, but
painfully depressed and silent.&nbsp; His late companions sought
in vain to lead him into conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How bitterly I wish,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;that I had
never brought you to this infamous abode!&nbsp; Begone, while you
are clean-handed.&nbsp; If you could have heard the old man
scream as he fell, and the noise of his bones upon the
pavement!&nbsp; Wish me, if you have any kindness to so fallen a
being&mdash;wish the ace of spades for me to-night!&rdquo;</p>
<p>A few more members dropped in as the evening went on, but the
club did not muster more than the devil&rsquo;s dozen when they
took their places at the table.&nbsp; The Prince was again
conscious of a certain joy in his alarms; but he was astonished
to see Geraldine so much more self-possessed than on the night
before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is extraordinary,&rdquo; thought the Prince,
&ldquo;that a will, made or unmade, should so greatly influence a
young man&rsquo;s spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Attention, gentlemen!&rdquo; said the President, and he
began to deal.</p>
<p>Three times the cards went all round the table, and neither of
the marked cards had yet fallen from his hand.&nbsp; The
excitement as he began the fourth distribution was
overwhelming.&nbsp; There were just cards enough to go once more
entirely round.&nbsp; The Prince, who sat second from the
dealer&rsquo;s left, would receive, in the reverse mode of
dealing practised at the club, the second last card.&nbsp; The
third player turned up a black ace&mdash;it was the ace of
clubs.&nbsp; The next received a diamond, the next a heart, and
so on; but the ace of spades was still undelivered.&nbsp; At
last, Geraldine, who sat upon the Prince&rsquo;s left, turned his
card; it was an ace, but the ace of hearts.</p>
<p>When Prince Florizel saw his fate upon the table in front of
him, his heart stood still.&nbsp; He was a brave man, but the
sweat poured off his face.&nbsp; There were exactly fifty chances
out of a hundred that he was doomed.&nbsp; He reversed the card;
it was the ace of spades.&nbsp; A loud roaring filled his brain,
and the table swam before his eyes.&nbsp; He heard the player on
his right break into a fit of laughter that sounded between mirth
and disappointment; he saw the company rapidly dispersing, but
his mind was full of other thoughts.&nbsp; He recognised how
foolish, how criminal, had been his conduct.&nbsp; In perfect
health, in the prime of his years, the heir to a throne, he had
gambled away his future and that of a brave and loyal
country.&nbsp; &ldquo;God,&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;God forgive
me!&rdquo;&nbsp; And with that, the confusion of his senses
passed away, and he regained his self-possession in a moment.</p>
<p>To his surprise Geraldine had disappeared.&nbsp; There was no
one in the card-room but his destined butcher consulting with the
President, and the young man of the cream tarts, who slipped up
to the Prince, and whispered in his ear:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would give a million, if I had it, for your
luck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His Highness could not help reflecting, as the young man
departed, that he would have sold his opportunity for a much more
moderate sum.</p>
<p>The whispered conference now came to an end.&nbsp; The holder
of the ace of clubs left the room with a look of intelligence,
and the President, approaching the unfortunate Prince, proffered
him his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am pleased to have met you, sir,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;and pleased to have been in a position to do you this
trifling service.&nbsp; At least, you cannot complain of
delay.&nbsp; On the second evening&mdash;what a stroke of
luck!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince endeavoured in vain to articulate something in
response, but his mouth was dry and his tongue seemed
paralysed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You feel a little sickish?&rdquo; asked the President,
with some show of solicitude.&nbsp; &ldquo;Most gentlemen
do.&nbsp; Will you take a little brandy?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince signified in the affirmative, and the other
immediately filled some of the spirit into a tumbler.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor old Malthy!&rdquo; ejaculated the President, as
the Prince drained the glass.&nbsp; &ldquo;He drank near upon a
pint, and little enough good it seemed to do him!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am more amenable to treatment,&rdquo; said the
Prince, a good deal revived.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am my own man again
at once, as you perceive.&nbsp; And so, let me ask you, what are
my directions?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will proceed along the Strand in the direction of
the City, and on the left-hand pavement, until you meet the
gentleman who has just left the room.&nbsp; He will continue your
instructions, and him you will have the kindness to obey; the
authority of the club is vested in his person for the
night.&nbsp; And now,&rdquo; added the President, &ldquo;I wish
you a pleasant walk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florizel acknowledged the salutation rather awkwardly, and
took his leave.&nbsp; He passed through the smoking-room, where
the bulk of the players were still consuming champagne, some of
which he had himself ordered and paid for; and he was surprised
to find himself cursing them in his heart.&nbsp; He put on his
hat and greatcoat in the cabinet, and selected his umbrella from
a corner.&nbsp; The familiarity of these acts, and the thought
that he was about them for the last time, betrayed him into a fit
of laughter which sounded unpleasantly in his own ears.&nbsp; He
conceived a reluctance to leave the cabinet, and turned instead
to the window.&nbsp; The sight of the lamps and the darkness
recalled him to himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, I must be a man,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;and tear myself away.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the corner of Box Court three men fell upon Prince Florizel
and he was unceremoniously thrust into a carriage, which at once
drove rapidly away.&nbsp; There was already an occupant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will your Highness pardon my zeal?&rdquo; said a well
known voice.</p>
<p>The Prince threw himself upon the Colonel&rsquo;s neck in a
passion of relief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How can I ever thank you?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And how was this effected?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Although he had been willing to march upon his doom, he was
overjoyed to yield to friendly violence, and return once more to
life and hope.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You can thank me effectually enough,&rdquo; replied the
Colonel, &ldquo;by avoiding all such dangers in the future.&nbsp;
And as for your second question, all has been managed by the
simplest means.&nbsp; I arranged this afternoon with a celebrated
detective.&nbsp; Secrecy has been promised and paid for.&nbsp;
Your own servants have been principally engaged in the
affair.&nbsp; The house in Box Court has been surrounded since
nightfall, and this, which is one of your own carriages, has been
awaiting you for nearly an hour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the miserable creature who was to have slain
me&mdash;what of him?&rdquo; inquired the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was pinioned as he left the club,&rdquo; replied the
Colonel, &ldquo;and now awaits your sentence at the Palace, where
he will soon be joined by his accomplices.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geraldine,&rdquo; said the Prince, &ldquo;you have
saved me against my explicit orders, and you have done
well.&nbsp; I owe you not only my life, but a lesson; and I
should be unworthy of my rank if I did not show myself grateful
to my teacher.&nbsp; Let it be yours to choose the
manner.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause, during which the carriage continued to
speed through the streets, and the two men were each buried in
his own reflections.&nbsp; The silence was broken by Colonel
Geraldine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;has by this time
a considerable body of prisoners.&nbsp; There is at least one
criminal among the number to whom justice should be dealt.&nbsp;
Our oath forbids us all recourse to law; and discretion would
forbid it equally if the oath were loosened.&nbsp; May I inquire
your Highness&rsquo;s intention?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is decided,&rdquo; answered Florizel; &ldquo;the
President must fall in duel.&nbsp; It only remains to choose his
adversary.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness has permitted me to name my own
recompense,&rdquo; said the Colonel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Will he permit
me to ask the appointment of my brother?&nbsp; It is an
honourable post, but I dare assure your Highness that the lad
will acquit himself with credit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You ask me an ungracious favour,&rdquo; said the
Prince, &ldquo;but I must refuse you nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Colonel kissed his hand with the greatest affection; and
at that moment the carriage rolled under the archway of the
Prince&rsquo;s splendid residence.</p>
<p>An hour after, Florizel in his official robes, and covered
with all the orders of Bohemia, received the members of the
Suicide Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Foolish and wicked men,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;as many
of you as have been driven into this strait by the lack of
fortune shall receive employment and remuneration from my
officers.&nbsp; Those who suffer under a sense of guilt must have
recourse to a higher and more generous Potentate than I.&nbsp; I
feel pity for all of you, deeper than you can imagine; to-morrow
you shall tell me your stories; and as you answer more frankly, I
shall be the more able to remedy your misfortunes.&nbsp; As for
you,&rdquo; he added, turning to the President, &ldquo;I should
only offend a person of your parts by any offer of assistance;
but I have instead a piece of diversion to propose to you.&nbsp;
Here,&rdquo; laying his hand on the shoulder of Colonel
Geraldine&rsquo;s young brother, &ldquo;is an officer of mine who
desires to make a little tour upon the Continent; and I ask you,
as a favour, to accompany him on this excursion.&nbsp; Do
you,&rdquo; he went on, changing his tone, &ldquo;do you shoot
well with the pistol?&nbsp; Because you may have need of that
accomplishment.&nbsp; When two men go travelling together, it is
best to be prepared for all.&nbsp; Let me add that, if by any
chance you should lose young Mr. Geraldine upon the way, I shall
always have another member of my household to place at your
disposal; and I am known, Mr. President, to have long eyesight,
and as long an arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words, said with much sternness, the Prince
concluded his address.&nbsp; Next morning the members of the club
were suitably provided for by his munificence, and the President
set forth upon his travels, under the supervision of Mr.
Geraldine, and a pair of faithful and adroit lackeys, well
trained in the Prince&rsquo;s household.&nbsp; Not content with
this, discreet agents were put in possession of the house in Box
Court, and all letters or visitors for the Suicide Club or its
officials were to be examined by Prince Florizel in person.</p>

<h3><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>STORY
OF THE PHYSICIAN AND THE SARATOGA TRUNK</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Mr. Silas Q. Scuddamore</span> was a young
American of a simple and harmless disposition, which was the more
to his credit as he came from New England&mdash;a quarter of the
New World not precisely famous for those qualities.&nbsp;
Although he was exceedingly rich, he kept a note of all his
expenses in a little paper pocket-book; and he had chosen to
study the attractions of Paris from the seventh story of what is
called a furnished hotel, in the Latin Quarter.&nbsp; There was a
great deal of habit in his penuriousness; and his virtue, which
was very remarkable among his associates, was principally founded
upon diffidence and youth.</p>
<p>The next room to his was inhabited by a lady, very attractive
in her air and very elegant in toilette, whom, on his first
arrival, he had taken for a Countess.&nbsp; In course of time he
had learned that she was known by the name of Madame
Z&eacute;phyrine, and that whatever station she occupied in life
it was not that of a person of title.&nbsp; Madame
Z&eacute;phyrine, probably in the hope of enchanting the young
American, used to flaunt by him on the stairs with a civil
inclination, a word of course, and a knock-down look out of her
black eyes, and disappear in a rustle of silk, and with the
revelation of an admirable foot and ankle.&nbsp; But these
advances, so far from encouraging Mr. Scuddamore, plunged him
into the depths of depression and bashfulness.&nbsp; She had come
to him several times for a light, or to apologise for the
imaginary depredations of her poodle; but his mouth was closed in
the presence of so superior a being, his French promptly left
him, and he could only stare and stammer until she was
gone.&nbsp; The slenderness of their intercourse did not prevent
him from throwing out insinuations of a very glorious order when
he was safely alone with a few males.</p>
<p>The room on the other side of the American&rsquo;s&mdash;for
there were three rooms on a floor in the hotel&mdash;was tenanted
by an old English physician of rather doubtful reputation.&nbsp;
Dr. Noel, for that was his name, had been forced to leave London,
where he enjoyed a large and increasing practice; and it was
hinted that the police had been the instigators of this change of
scene.&nbsp; At least he, who had made something of a figure in
earlier life, now dwelt in the Latin Quarter in great simplicity
and solitude, and devoted much of his time to study.&nbsp; Mr.
Scuddamore had made his acquaintance, and the pair would now and
then dine together frugally in a restaurant across the
street.</p>
<p>Silas Q. Scuddamore had many little vices of the more
respectable order, and was not restrained by delicacy from
indulging them in many rather doubtful ways.&nbsp; Chief among
his foibles stood curiosity.&nbsp; He was a born gossip; and
life, and especially those parts of it in which he had no
experience, interested him to the degree of passion.&nbsp; He was
a pert, invincible questioner, pushing his inquiries with equal
pertinacity and indiscretion; he had been observed, when he took
a letter to the post, to weigh it in his hand, to turn it over
and over, and to study the address with care; and when he found a
flaw in the partition between his room and Madame
Z&eacute;phyrine&rsquo;s, instead of filling it up, he enlarged
and improved the opening, and made use of it as a spy-hole on his
neighbour&rsquo;s affairs.</p>
<p>One day, in the end of March, his curiosity growing as it was
indulged, he enlarged the hole a little further, so that he might
command another corner of the room.&nbsp; That evening, when he
went as usual to inspect Madame Z&eacute;phyrine&rsquo;s
movements, he was astonished to find the aperture obscured in an
odd manner on the other side, and still more abashed when the
obstacle was suddenly withdrawn and a titter of laughter reached
his ears.&nbsp; Some of the plaster had evidently betrayed the
secret of his spy-hole, and his neighbour had been returning the
compliment in kind.&nbsp; Mr. Scuddamore was moved to a very
acute feeling of annoyance; he condemned Madame Z&eacute;phyrine
unmercifully; he even blamed himself; but when he found, next
day, that she had taken no means to baulk him of his favourite
pastime, he continued to profit by her carelessness, and gratify
his idle curiosity.</p>
<p>That next day Madame Z&eacute;phyrine received a long visit
from a tall, loosely-built man of fifty or upwards, whom Silas
had not hitherto seen.&nbsp; His tweed suit and coloured shirt,
no less than his shaggy side-whiskers, identified him as a
Britisher, and his dull grey eye affected Silas with a sense of
cold.&nbsp; He kept screwing his mouth from side to side and
round and round during the whole colloquy, which was carried on
in whispers.&nbsp; More than once it seemed to the young New
Englander as if their gestures indicated his own apartment; but
the only thing definite he could gather by the most scrupulous
attention was this remark made by the Englishman in a somewhat
higher key, as if in answer to some reluctance or opposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have studied his taste to a nicety, and I tell you
again and again you are the only woman of the sort that I can lay
my hands on.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In answer to this, Madame Z&eacute;phyrine sighed, and
appeared by a gesture to resign herself, like one yielding to
unqualified authority.</p>
<p>That afternoon the observatory was finally blinded, a wardrobe
having been drawn in front of it upon the other side; and while
Silas was still lamenting over this misfortune, which he
attributed to the Britisher&rsquo;s malign suggestion, the
concierge brought him up a letter in a female handwriting.&nbsp;
It was conceived in French of no very rigorous orthography, bore
no signature, and in the most encouraging terms invited the young
American to be present in a certain part of the Bullier Ball at
eleven o&rsquo;clock that night.&nbsp; Curiosity and timidity
fought a long battle in his heart; sometimes he was all virtue,
sometimes all fire and daring; and the result of it was that,
long before ten, Mr. Silas Q. Scuddamore presented himself in
unimpeachable attire at the door of the Bullier Ball Rooms, and
paid his entry money with a sense of reckless devilry that was
not without its charm.</p>
<p>It was Carnival time, and the Ball was very full and
noisy.&nbsp; The lights and the crowd at first rather abashed our
young adventurer, and then, mounting to his brain with a sort of
intoxication, put him in possession of more than his own share of
manhood.&nbsp; He felt ready to face the devil, and strutted in
the ballroom with the swagger of a cavalier.&nbsp; While he was
thus parading, he became aware of Madame Z&eacute;phyrine and her
Britisher in conference behind a pillar.&nbsp; The cat-like
spirit of eaves-dropping overcame him at once.&nbsp; He stole
nearer and nearer on the couple from behind, until he was within
earshot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is the man,&rdquo; the Britisher was saying;
&ldquo;there&mdash;with the long blond hair&mdash;speaking to a
girl in green.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas identified a very handsome young fellow of small
stature, who was plainly the object of this designation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; said Madame Z&eacute;phyrine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I shall do my utmost.&nbsp; But, remember, the best of us
may fail in such a matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tut!&rdquo; returned her companion; &ldquo;I answer for
the result.&nbsp; Have I not chosen you from thirty?&nbsp; Go;
but be wary of the Prince.&nbsp; I cannot think what cursed
accident has brought him here to-night.&nbsp; As if there were
not a dozen balls in Paris better worth his notice than this riot
of students and counter-jumpers!&nbsp; See him where he sits,
more like a reigning Emperor at home than a Prince upon his
holidays!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas was again lucky.&nbsp; He observed a person of rather a
full build, strikingly handsome, and of a very stately and
courteous demeanour, seated at table with another handsome young
man, several years his junior, who addressed him with conspicuous
deference.&nbsp; The name of Prince struck gratefully on
Silas&rsquo;s Republican hearing, and the aspect of the person to
whom that name was applied exercised its usual charm upon his
mind.&nbsp; He left Madame Z&eacute;phyrine and her Englishman to
take care of each other, and threading his way through the
assembly, approached the table which the Prince and his confidant
had honoured with their choice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I tell you, Geraldine,&rdquo; the former was saying,
&ldquo;the action is madness.&nbsp; Yourself (I am glad to
remember it) chose your brother for this perilous service, and
you are bound in duty to have a guard upon his conduct.&nbsp; He
has consented to delay so many days in Paris; that was already an
imprudence, considering the character of the man he has to deal
with; but now, when he is within eight-and-forty hours of his
departure, when he is within two or three days of the decisive
trial, I ask you, is this a place for him to spend his
time?&nbsp; He should be in a gallery at practice; he should be
sleeping long hours and taking moderate exercise on foot; he
should be on a rigorous diet, without white wines or
brandy.&nbsp; Does the dog imagine we are all playing
comedy?&nbsp; The thing is deadly earnest, Geraldine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know the lad too well to interfere,&rdquo; replied
Colonel Geraldine, &ldquo;and well enough not to be
alarmed.&nbsp; He is more cautious than you fancy, and of an
indomitable spirit.&nbsp; If it had been a woman I should not say
so much, but I trust the President to him and the two valets
without an instant&rsquo;s apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am gratified to hear you say so,&rdquo; replied the
Prince; &ldquo;but my mind is not at rest.&nbsp; These servants
are well-trained spies, and already has not this miscreant
succeeded three times in eluding their observation and spending
several hours on end in private, and most likely dangerous,
affairs?&nbsp; An amateur might have lost him by accident, but if
Rudolph and J&eacute;rome were thrown off the scent, it must have
been done on purpose, and by a man who had a cogent reason and
exceptional resources.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe the question is now one between my brother
and myself,&rdquo; replied Geraldine, with a shade of offence in
his tone.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I permit it to be so, Colonel Geraldine,&rdquo;
returned Prince Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;Perhaps, for that very
reason, you should be all the more ready to accept my
counsels.&nbsp; But enough.&nbsp; That girl in yellow dances
well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the talk veered into the ordinary topics of a Paris
ballroom in the Carnival.</p>
<p>Silas remembered where he was, and that the hour was already
near at hand when he ought to be upon the scene of his
assignation.&nbsp; The more he reflected the less he liked the
prospect, and as at that moment an eddy in the crowd began to
draw him in the direction of the door, he suffered it to carry
him away without resistance.&nbsp; The eddy stranded him in a
corner under the gallery, where his ear was immediately struck
with the voice of Madame Z&eacute;phyrine.&nbsp; She was speaking
in French with the young man of the blond locks who had been
pointed out by the strange Britisher not half-an-hour before.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have a character at stake,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;or
I would put no other condition than my heart recommends.&nbsp;
But you have only to say so much to the porter, and he will let
you go by without a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why this talk of debt?&rdquo; objected her
companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;do you think I do not
understand my own hotel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And she went by, clinging affectionately to her
companion&rsquo;s arm.</p>
<p>This put Silas in mind of his billet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten minutes hence,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;and I may
be walking with as beautiful a woman as that, and even better
dressed&mdash;perhaps a real lady, possibly a woman or
title.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he remembered the spelling, and was a little
downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But it may have been written by her maid,&rdquo; he
imagined.</p>
<p>The clock was only a few minutes from the hour, and this
immediate proximity set his heart beating at a curious and rather
disagreeable speed.&nbsp; He reflected with relief that he was in
no way bound to put in an appearance.&nbsp; Virtue and cowardice
were together, and he made once more for the door, but this time
of his own accord, and battling against the stream of people
which was now moving in a contrary direction.&nbsp; Perhaps this
prolonged resistance wearied him, or perhaps he was in that frame
of mind when merely to continue in the same determination for a
certain number of minutes produces a reaction and a different
purpose.&nbsp; Certainly, at least, he wheeled about for a third
time, and did not stop until he had found a place of concealment
within a few yards of the appointed place.</p>
<p>Here he went through an agony of spirit, in which he several
times prayed to God for help, for Silas had been devoutly
educated.&nbsp; He had now not the least inclination for the
meeting; nothing kept him from flight but a silly fear lest he
should be thought unmanly; but this was so powerful that it kept
head against all other motives; and although it could not decide
him to advance, prevented him from definitely running away.&nbsp;
At last the clock indicated ten minutes past the hour.&nbsp;
Young Scuddamore&rsquo;s spirit began to rise; he peered round
the corner and saw no one at the place of meeting; doubtless his
unknown correspondent had wearied and gone away.&nbsp; He became
as bold as he had formerly been timid.&nbsp; It seemed to him
that if he came at all to the appointment, however late, he was
clear from the charge of cowardice.&nbsp; Nay, now he began to
suspect a hoax, and actually complimented himself on his
shrewdness in having suspected and outmanoeuvred his
mystifiers.&nbsp; So very idle a thing is a boy&rsquo;s mind!</p>
<p>Armed with these reflections, he advanced boldly from his
corner; but he had not taken above a couple of steps before a
hand was laid upon his arm.&nbsp; He turned and beheld a lady
cast in a very large mould and with somewhat stately features,
but bearing no mark of severity in her looks.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see that you are a very self-confident
lady-killer,&rdquo; said she; &ldquo;for you make yourself
expected.&nbsp; But I was determined to meet you.&nbsp; When a
woman has once so far forgotten herself as to make the first
advance, she has long ago left behind her all considerations of
petty pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas was overwhelmed by the size and attractions of his
correspondent and the suddenness with which she had fallen upon
him.&nbsp; But she soon set him at his ease.&nbsp; She was very
towardly and lenient in her behaviour; she led him on to make
pleasantries, and then applauded him to the echo; and in a very
short time, between blandishments and a liberal exhibition of
warm brandy, she had not only induced him to fancy himself in
love, but to declare his passion with the greatest vehemence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I do not know whether I
ought not to deplore this moment, great as is the pleasure you
give me by your words.&nbsp; Hitherto I was alone to suffer; now,
poor boy, there will be two.&nbsp; I am not my own
mistress.&nbsp; I dare not ask you to visit me at my own house,
for I am watched by jealous eyes.&nbsp; Let me see,&rdquo; she
added; &ldquo;I am older than you, although so much weaker; and
while I trust in your courage and determination, I must employ my
own knowledge of the world for our mutual benefit.&nbsp; Where do
you live?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He told her that he lodged in a furnished hotel, and named the
street and number.</p>
<p>She seemed to reflect for some minutes, with an effort of
mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; she said at last.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will
be faithful and obedient, will you not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas assured her eagerly of his fidelity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-morrow night, then,&rdquo; she continued, with an
encouraging smile, &ldquo;you must remain at home all the
evening; and if any friends should visit you, dismiss them at
once on any pretext that most readily presents itself.&nbsp; Your
door is probably shut by ten?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By eleven,&rdquo; answered Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At a quarter past eleven,&rdquo; pursued the lady,
&ldquo;leave the house.&nbsp; Merely cry for the door to be
opened, and be sure you fall into no talk with the porter, as
that might ruin everything.&nbsp; Go straight to the corner where
the Luxembourg Gardens join the Boulevard; there you will find me
waiting you.&nbsp; I trust you to follow my advice from point to
point: and remember, if you fail me in only one particular, you
will bring the sharpest trouble on a woman whose only fault is to
have seen and loved you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot see the use of all these instructions,&rdquo;
said Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you are already beginning to treat me as a
master,&rdquo; she cried, tapping him with her fan upon the
arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;Patience, patience! that should come in
time.&nbsp; A woman loves to be obeyed at first, although
afterwards she finds her pleasure in obeying.&nbsp; Do as I ask
you, for Heaven&rsquo;s sake, or I will answer for nothing.&nbsp;
Indeed, now I think of it,&rdquo; she added, with the manner of
one who has just seen further into a difficulty, &ldquo;I find a
better plan of keeping importunate visitors away.&nbsp; Tell the
porter to admit no one for you, except a person who may come that
night to claim a debt; and speak with some feeling, as though you
feared the interview, so that he may take your words in
earnest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think you may trust me to protect myself against
intruders,&rdquo; he said, not without a little pique.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is how I should prefer the thing arranged,&rdquo;
she answered coldly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know you men; you think
nothing of a woman&rsquo;s reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas blushed and somewhat hung his head; for the scheme he
had in view had involved a little vain-glorying before his
acquaintances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Above all,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;do not speak to the
porter as you come out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And why?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Of all your
instructions, that seems to me the least important.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You at first doubted the wisdom of some of the others,
which you now see to be very necessary,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Believe me, this also has its uses; in time you will see
them; and what am I to think of your affection, if you refuse me
such trifles at our first interview?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas confounded himself in explanations and apologies; in the
middle of these she looked up at the clock and clapped her hands
together with a suppressed scream.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;is it so late?&nbsp;
I have not an instant to lose.&nbsp; Alas, we poor women, what
slaves we are!&nbsp; What have I not risked for you
already?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And after repeating her directions, which she artfully
combined with caresses and the most abandoned looks, she bade him
farewell and disappeared among the crowd.</p>
<p>The whole of the next day Silas was filled with a sense of
great importance; he was now sure she was a countess; and when
evening came he minutely obeyed her orders and was at the corner
of the Luxembourg Gardens by the hour appointed.&nbsp; No one was
there.&nbsp; He waited nearly half-an-hour, looking in the face
of every one who passed or loitered near the spot; he even
visited the neighbouring corners of the Boulevard and made a
complete circuit of the garden railings; but there was no
beautiful countess to throw herself into his arms.&nbsp; At last,
and most reluctantly, he began to retrace his steps towards his
hotel.&nbsp; On the way he remembered the words he had heard pass
between Madame Z&eacute;phyrine and the blond young man, and they
gave him an indefinite uneasiness.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It appears,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;that every one
has to tell lies to our porter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He rang the bell, the door opened before him, and the porter
in his bed-clothes came to offer him a light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has he gone?&rdquo; inquired the porter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He?&nbsp; Whom do you mean?&rdquo; asked Silas,
somewhat sharply, for he was irritated by his disappointment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not notice him go out,&rdquo; continued the
porter, &ldquo;but I trust you paid him.&nbsp; We do not care, in
this house, to have lodgers who cannot meet their
liabilities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What the devil do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Silas
rudely.&nbsp; &ldquo;I cannot understand a word of this
farrago.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The short blond young man who came for his debt,&rdquo;
returned the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;Him it is I mean.&nbsp; Who else
should it be, when I had your orders to admit no one
else?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, good God, of course he never came,&rdquo; retorted
Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe what I believe,&rdquo; returned the porter,
putting his tongue into his cheek with a most roguish air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an insolent scoundrel,&rdquo; cried Silas, and,
feeling that he had made a ridiculous exhibition of asperity, and
at the same time bewildered by a dozen alarms, he turned and
began to run upstairs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you not want a light then?&rdquo; cried the
porter.</p>
<p>But Silas only hurried the faster, and did not pause until he
had reached the seventh landing and stood in front of his own
door.&nbsp; There he waited a moment to recover his breath,
assailed by the worst forebodings and almost dreading to enter
the room.</p>
<p>When at last he did so he was relieved to find it dark, and to
all appearance, untenanted.&nbsp; He drew a long breath.&nbsp;
Here he was, home again in safety, and this should be his last
folly as certainly as it had been his first.&nbsp; The matches
stood on a little table by the bed, and he began to grope his way
in that direction.&nbsp; As he moved, his apprehensions grew upon
him once more, and he was pleased, when his foot encountered an
obstacle, to find it nothing more alarming than a chair.&nbsp; At
last he touched curtains.&nbsp; From the position of the window,
which was faintly visible, he knew he must be at the foot of the
bed, and had only to feel his way along it in order to reach the
table in question.</p>
<p>He lowered his hand, but what it touched was not simply a
counterpane&mdash;it was a counterpane with something underneath
it like the outline of a human leg.&nbsp; Silas withdrew his arm
and stood a moment petrified.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, what,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;can this
betoken?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He listened intently, but there was no sound of
breathing.&nbsp; Once more, with a great effort, he reached out
the end of his finger to the spot he had already touched; but
this time he leaped back half a yard, and stood shivering and
fixed with terror.&nbsp; There was something in his bed.&nbsp;
What it was he knew not, but there was something there.</p>
<p>It was some seconds before he could move.&nbsp; Then, guided
by an instinct, he fell straight upon the matches, and keeping
his back towards the bed lighted a candle.&nbsp; As soon as the
flame had kindled, he turned slowly round and looked for what he
feared to see.&nbsp; Sure enough, there was the worst of his
imaginations realised.&nbsp; The coverlid was drawn carefully up
over the pillow, but it moulded the outline of a human body lying
motionless; and when he dashed forward and flung aside the
sheets, he beheld the blond young man whom he had seen in the
Bullier Ball the night before, his eyes open and without
speculation, his face swollen and blackened, and a thin stream of
blood trickling from his nostrils.</p>
<p>Silas uttered a long, tremulous wail, dropped the candle, and
fell on his knees beside the bed.</p>
<p>Silas was awakened from the stupor into which his terrible
discovery had plunged him by a prolonged but discreet tapping at
the door.&nbsp; It took him some seconds to remember his
position; and when he hastened to prevent anyone from entering it
was already too late.&nbsp; Dr. Noel, in a tall night-cap,
carrying a lamp which lighted up his long white countenance,
sidling in his gait, and peering and cocking his head like some
sort of bird, pushed the door slowly open, and advanced into the
middle of the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought I heard a cry,&rdquo; began the Doctor,
&ldquo;and fearing you might be unwell I did not hesitate to
offer this intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas, with a flushed face and a fearful beating heart, kept
between the Doctor and the bed; but he found no voice to
answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are in the dark,&rdquo; pursued the Doctor;
&ldquo;and yet you have not even begun to prepare for rest.&nbsp;
You will not easily persuade me against my own eyesight; and your
face declares most eloquently that you require either a friend or
a physician&mdash;which is it to be?&nbsp; Let me feel your
pulse, for that is often a just reporter of the heart.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He advanced to Silas, who still retreated before him
backwards, and sought to take him by the wrist; but the strain on
the young American&rsquo;s nerves had become too great for
endurance.&nbsp; He avoided the Doctor with a febrile movement,
and, throwing himself upon the floor, burst into a flood of
weeping.</p>
<p>As soon as Dr. Noel perceived the dead man in the bed his face
darkened; and hurrying back to the door which he had left ajar,
he hastily closed and double-locked it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Up!&rdquo; he cried, addressing Silas in strident
tones; &ldquo;this is no time for weeping.&nbsp; What have you
done?&nbsp; How came this body in your room?&nbsp; Speak freely
to one who may be helpful.&nbsp; Do you imagine I would ruin
you?&nbsp; Do you think this piece of dead flesh on your pillow
can alter in any degree the sympathy with which you have inspired
me?&nbsp; Credulous youth, the horror with which blind and unjust
law regards an action never attaches to the doer in the eyes of
those who love him; and if I saw the friend of my heart return to
me out of seas of blood he would be in no way changed in my
affection.&nbsp; Raise yourself,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;good and
ill are a chimera; there is nought in life except destiny, and
however you may be circumstanced there is one at your side who
will help you to the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thus encouraged, Silas gathered himself together, and in a
broken voice, and helped out by the Doctor&rsquo;s
interrogations, contrived at last to put him in possession of the
facts.&nbsp; But the conversation between the Prince and
Geraldine he altogether omitted, as he had understood little of
its purport, and had no idea that it was in any way related to
his own misadventure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Dr. Noel, &ldquo;I am much abused,
or you have fallen innocently into the most dangerous hands in
Europe.&nbsp; Poor boy, what a pit has been dug for your
simplicity! into what a deadly peril have your unwary feet been
conducted!&nbsp; This man,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this
Englishman, whom you twice saw, and whom I suspect to be the soul
of the contrivance, can you describe him?&nbsp; Was he young or
old? tall or short?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Silas, who, for all his curiosity, had not a seeing eye in
his head, was able to supply nothing but meagre generalities,
which it was impossible to recognise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have it a piece of education in all
schools!&rdquo; cried the Doctor angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where is
the use of eyesight and articulate speech if a man cannot observe
and recollect the features of his enemy?&nbsp; I, who know all
the gangs of Europe, might have identified him, and gained new
weapons for your defence.&nbsp; Cultivate this art in future, my
poor boy; you may find it of momentous service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The future!&rdquo; repeated Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;What
future is there left for me except the gallows?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Youth is but a cowardly season,&rdquo; returned the
Doctor; &ldquo;and a man&rsquo;s own troubles look blacker than
they are.&nbsp; I am old, and yet I never despair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can I tell such a story to the police?&rdquo; demanded
Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Assuredly not,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;From what I see already of the machination in which you
have been involved, your case is desperate upon that side; and
for the narrow eye of the authorities you are infallibly the
guilty person.&nbsp; And remember that we only know a portion of
the plot; and the same infamous contrivers have doubtless
arranged many other circumstances which would be elicited by a
police inquiry, and help to fix the guilt more certainly upon
your innocence.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am then lost, indeed!&rdquo; cried Silas.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not said so,&rdquo; answered Dr. Noel &ldquo;for
I am a cautious man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But look at this!&rdquo; objected Silas, pointing to
the body.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is this object in my bed; not to be
explained, not to be disposed of, not to be regarded without
horror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Horror?&rdquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp;
&ldquo;No.&nbsp; When this sort of clock has run down, it is no
more to me than an ingenious piece of mechanism, to be
investigated with the bistoury.&nbsp; When blood is once cold and
stagnant, it is no longer human blood; when flesh is once dead,
it is no longer that flesh which we desire in our lovers and
respect in our friends.&nbsp; The grace, the attraction, the
terror, have all gone from it with the animating spirit.&nbsp;
Accustom yourself to look upon it with composure; for if my
scheme is practicable you will have to live some days in constant
proximity to that which now so greatly horrifies you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your scheme?&rdquo; cried Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;What is
that?&nbsp; Tell me speedily, Doctor; for I have scarcely courage
enough to continue to exist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without replying, Doctor Noel turned towards the bed, and
proceeded to examine the corpse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quite dead,&rdquo; he murmured.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yes, as I
had supposed, the pockets empty.&nbsp; Yes, and the name cut off
the shirt.&nbsp; Their work has been done thoroughly and
well.&nbsp; Fortunately, he is of small stature.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas followed these words with an extreme anxiety.&nbsp; At
last the Doctor, his autopsy completed, took a chair and
addressed the young American with a smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Since I came into your room,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;although my ears and my tongue have been so busy, I have
not suffered my eyes to remain idle.&nbsp; I noted a little while
ago that you have there, in the corner, one of those monstrous
constructions which your fellow-countrymen carry with them into
all quarters of the globe&mdash;in a word, a Saratoga
trunk.&nbsp; Until this moment I have never been able to conceive
the utility of these erections; but then I began to have a
glimmer.&nbsp; Whether it was for convenience in the slave trade,
or to obviate the results of too ready an employment of the
bowie-knife, I cannot bring myself to decide.&nbsp; But one thing
I see plainly&mdash;the object of such a box is to contain a
human body.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Surely,&rdquo; cried Silas, &ldquo;surely this is not a
time for jesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Although I may express myself with some degree of
pleasantry,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;the purport of my
words is entirely serious.&nbsp; And the first thing we have to
do, my young friend, is to empty your coffer of all that it
contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas, obeying the authority of Doctor Noel, put himself at
his disposition.&nbsp; The Saratoga trunk was soon gutted of its
contents, which made a considerable litter on the floor; and
then&mdash;Silas taking the heels and the Doctor supporting the
shoulders&mdash;the body of the murdered man was carried from the
bed, and, after some difficulty, doubled up and inserted whole
into the empty box.&nbsp; With an effort on the part of both, the
lid was forced down upon this unusual baggage, and the trunk was
locked and corded by the Doctor&rsquo;s own hand, while Silas
disposed of what had been taken out between the closet and a
chest of drawers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;the first step has
been taken on the way to your deliverance.&nbsp; To-morrow, or
rather to-day, it must be your task to allay the suspicions of
your porter, paying him all that you owe; while you may trust me
to make the arrangements necessary to a safe conclusion.&nbsp;
Meantime, follow me to my room, where I shall give you a safe and
powerful opiate; for, whatever you do, you must have
rest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next day was the longest in Silas&rsquo;s memory; it
seemed as if it would never be done.&nbsp; He denied himself to
his friends, and sat in a corner with his eyes fixed upon the
Saratoga trunk in dismal contemplation.&nbsp; His own former
indiscretions were now returned upon him in kind; for the
observatory had been once more opened, and he was conscious of an
almost continual study from Madame Z&eacute;phyrine&rsquo;s
apartment.&nbsp; So distressing did this become, that he was at
last obliged to block up the spy-hole from his own side; and when
he was thus secured from observation he spent a considerable
portion of his time in contrite tears and prayer.</p>
<p>Late in the evening Dr. Noel entered the room carrying in his
hand a pair of sealed envelopes without address, one somewhat
bulky, and the other so slim as to seem without enclosure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silas,&rdquo; he said, seating himself at the table,
&ldquo;the time has now come for me to explain my plan for your
salvation.&nbsp; To-morrow morning, at an early hour, Prince
Florizel of Bohemia returns to London, after having diverted
himself for a few days with the Parisian Carnival.&nbsp; It was
my fortune, a good while ago, to do Colonel Geraldine, his Master
of the Horse, one of those services, so common in my profession,
which are never forgotten upon either side.&nbsp; I have no need
to explain to you the nature of the obligation under which he was
laid; suffice it to say that I knew him ready to serve me in any
practicable manner.&nbsp; Now, it was necessary for you to gain
London with your trunk unopened.&nbsp; To this the Custom House
seemed to oppose a fatal difficulty; but I bethought me that the
baggage of so considerable a person as the Prince, is, as a
matter of courtesy, passed without examination by the officers of
Custom.&nbsp; I applied to Colonel Geraldine, and succeeded in
obtaining a favourable answer.&nbsp; To-morrow, if you go before
six to the hotel where the Prince lodges, your baggage will be
passed over as a part of his, and you yourself will make the
journey as a member of his suite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems to me, as you speak, that I have already seen
both the Prince and Colonel Geraldine; I even overheard some of
their conversation the other evening at the Bullier
Ball.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is probable enough; for the Prince loves to mix with
all societies,&rdquo; replied the Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once
arrived in London,&rdquo; he pursued, &ldquo;your task is nearly
ended.&nbsp; In this more bulky envelope I have given you a
letter which I dare not address; but in the other you will find
the designation of the house to which you must carry it along
with your box, which will there be taken from you and not trouble
you any more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; said Silas, &ldquo;I have every wish to
believe you; but how is it possible?&nbsp; You open up to me a
bright prospect, but, I ask you, is my mind capable of receiving
so unlikely a solution?&nbsp; Be more generous, and let me
further understand your meaning.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor seemed painfully impressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Boy,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;you do not know how
hard a thing you ask of me.&nbsp; But be it so.&nbsp; I am now
inured to humiliation; and it would be strange if I refused you
this, after having granted you so much.&nbsp; Know, then, that
although I now make so quiet an appearance&mdash;frugal,
solitary, addicted to study&mdash;when I was younger, my name was
once a rallying-cry among the most astute and dangerous spirits
of London; and while I was outwardly an object for respect and
consideration, my true power resided in the most secret,
terrible, and criminal relations.&nbsp; It is to one of the
persons who then obeyed me that I now address myself to deliver
you from your burden.&nbsp; They were men of many different
nations and dexterities, all bound together by a formidable oath,
and working to the same purposes; the trade of the association
was in murder; and I who speak to you, innocent as I appear, was
the chieftain of this redoubtable crew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;A
murderer?&nbsp; And one with whom murder was a trade?&nbsp; Can I
take your hand?&nbsp; Ought I so much as to accept your
services?&nbsp; Dark and criminal old man, would you make an
accomplice of my youth and my distress?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Doctor bitterly laughed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are difficult to please, Mr. Scuddamore,&rdquo;
said he; &ldquo;but I now offer you your choice of company
between the murdered man and the murderer.&nbsp; If your
conscience is too nice to accept my aid, say so, and I will
immediately leave you.&nbsp; Thenceforward you can deal with your
trunk and its belongings as best suits your upright
conscience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I own myself wrong,&rdquo; replied Silas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I should have remembered how generously you offered to
shield me, even before I had convinced you of my innocence, and I
continue to listen to your counsels with gratitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is well,&rdquo; returned the Doctor; &ldquo;and I
perceive you are beginning to learn some of the lessons of
experience.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; resumed the New-Englander,
&ldquo;as you confess yourself accustomed to this tragical
business, and the people to whom you recommend me are your own
former associates and friends, could you not yourself undertake
the transport of the box, and rid me at once of its detested
presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; replied the Doctor, &ldquo;I
admire you cordially.&nbsp; If you do not think I have already
meddled sufficiently in your concerns, believe me, from my heart
I think the contrary.&nbsp; Take or leave my services as I offer
them; and trouble me with no more words of gratitude, for I value
your consideration even more lightly than I do your
intellect.&nbsp; A time will come, if you should be spared to see
a number of years in health of mind, when you will think
differently of all this, and blush for your to-night&rsquo;s
behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, the Doctor arose from his chair, repeated his
directions briefly and clearly, and departed from the room
without permitting Silas any time to answer.</p>
<p>The next morning Silas presented himself at the hotel, where
he was politely received by Colonel Geraldine, and relieved, from
that moment, of all immediate alarm about his trunk and its
grisly contents.&nbsp; The journey passed over without much
incident, although the young man was horrified to overhear the
sailors and railway porters complaining among themselves about
the unusual weight of the Prince&rsquo;s baggage.&nbsp; Silas
travelled in a carriage with the valets, for Prince Florizel
chose to be alone with his Master of the Horse.&nbsp; On board
the steamer, however, Silas attracted his Highness&rsquo;s
attention by the melancholy of his air and attitude as he stood
gazing at the pile of baggage; for he was still full of
disquietude about the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a young man,&rdquo; observed the Prince,
&ldquo;who must have some cause for sorrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That,&rdquo; replied Geraldine, &ldquo;is the American
for whom I obtained permission to travel with your
suite.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You remind me that I have been remiss in
courtesy,&rdquo; said Prince Florizel, and advancing to Silas, he
addressed him with the most exquisite condescension in these
words:&mdash;&ldquo;I was charmed, young sir, to be able to
gratify the desire you made known to me through Colonel
Geraldine.&nbsp; Remember, if you please, that I shall be glad at
any future time to lay you under a more serious
obligation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he then put some questions as to the political condition
of America, which Silas answered with sense and propriety.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are still a young man,&rdquo; said the Prince;
&ldquo;but I observe you to be very serious for your years.&nbsp;
Perhaps you allow your attention to be too much occupied with
grave studies.&nbsp; But, perhaps, on the other hand, I am myself
indiscreet and touch upon a painful subject.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have certainly cause to be the most miserable of
men,&rdquo; said Silas; &ldquo;never has a more innocent person
been more dismally abused.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not ask you for your confidence,&rdquo; returned
Prince Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;But do not forget that Colonel
Geraldine&rsquo;s recommendation is an unfailing passport; and
that I am not only willing, but possibly more able than many
others, to do you a service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas was delighted with the amiability of this great
personage; but his mind soon returned upon its gloomy
preoccupations; for not even the favour of a Prince to a
Republican can discharge a brooding spirit of its cares.</p>
<p>The train arrived at Charing Cross, where the officers of the
Revenue respected the baggage of Prince Florizel in the usual
manner.&nbsp; The most elegant equipages were in waiting; and
Silas was driven, along with the rest, to the Prince&rsquo;s
residence.&nbsp; There Colonel Geraldine sought him out, and
expressed himself pleased to have been of any service to a friend
of the physician&rsquo;s, for whom he professed a great
consideration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you will find none
of your porcelain injured.&nbsp; Special orders were given along
the line to deal tenderly with the Prince&rsquo;s
effects.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then, directing the servants to place one of the carriages
at the young gentleman&rsquo;s disposal, and at once to charge
the Saratoga trunk upon the dickey, the Colonel shook hands and
excused himself on account of his occupations in the princely
household.</p>
<p>Silas now broke the seal of the envelope containing the
address, and directed the stately footman to drive him to Box
Court, opening off the Strand.&nbsp; It seemed as if the place
were not at all unknown to the man, for he looked startled and
begged a repetition of the order.&nbsp; It was with a heart full
of alarms, that Silas mounted into the luxurious vehicle, and was
driven to his destination.&nbsp; The entrance to Box Court was
too narrow for the passage of a coach; it was a mere footway
between railings, with a post at either end.&nbsp; On one of
these posts was seated a man, who at once jumped down and
exchanged a friendly sign with the driver, while the footman
opened the door and inquired of Silas whether he should take down
the Saratoga trunk, and to what number it should be carried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you please,&rdquo; said Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;To
number three.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The footman and the man who had been sitting on the post, even
with the aid of Silas himself, had hard work to carry in the
trunk; and before it was deposited at the door of the house in
question, the young American was horrified to find a score of
loiterers looking on.&nbsp; But he knocked with as good a
countenance as he could muster up, and presented the other
envelope to him who opened.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is not at home,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but if you
will leave your letter and return to-morrow early, I shall be
able to inform you whether and when he can receive your
visit.&nbsp; Would you like to leave your box?&rdquo; he
added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dearly,&rdquo; cried Silas; and the next moment he
repented his precipitation, and declared, with equal emphasis,
that he would rather carry the box along with him to the
hotel.</p>
<p>The crowd jeered at his indecision and followed him to the
carriage with insulting remarks; and Silas, covered with shame
and terror, implored the servants to conduct him to some quiet
and comfortable house of entertainment in the immediate
neighbourhood.</p>
<p>The Prince&rsquo;s equipage deposited Silas at the Craven
Hotel in Craven Street, and immediately drove away, leaving him
alone with the servants of the inn.&nbsp; The only vacant room,
it appeared, was a little den up four pairs of stairs, and
looking towards the back.&nbsp; To this hermitage, with infinite
trouble and complaint, a pair of stout porters carried the
Saratoga trunk.&nbsp; It is needless to mention that Silas kept
closely at their heels throughout the ascent, and had his heart
in his mouth at every corner.&nbsp; A single false step, he
reflected, and the box might go over the banisters and land its
fatal contents, plainly discovered, on the pavement of the
hall.</p>
<p>Arrived in the room, he sat down on the edge of his bed to
recover from the agony that he had just endured; but he had
hardly taken his position when he was recalled to a sense of his
peril by the action of the boots, who had knelt beside the trunk,
and was proceeding officiously to undo its elaborate
fastenings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let it be!&rdquo; cried Silas.&nbsp; &ldquo;I shall
want nothing from it while I stay here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You might have let it lie in the hall, then,&rdquo;
growled the man; &ldquo;a thing as big and heavy as a
church.&nbsp; What you have inside I cannot fancy.&nbsp; If it is
all money, you are a richer man than me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Money?&rdquo; repeated Silas, in a sudden
perturbation.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean by money?&nbsp; I
have no money, and you are speaking like a fool.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right, captain,&rdquo; retorted the boots with a
wink.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s nobody will touch your
lordship&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m as safe as the
bank,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;but as the box is heavy, I
shouldn&rsquo;t mind drinking something to your lordship&rsquo;s
health.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas pressed two Napoleons upon his acceptance, apologising,
at the same time, for being obliged to trouble him with foreign
money, and pleading his recent arrival for excuse.&nbsp; And the
man, grumbling with even greater fervour, and looking
contemptuously from the money in his hand to the Saratoga trunk
and back again from the one to the other, at last consented to
withdraw.</p>
<p>For nearly two days the dead body had been packed into
Silas&rsquo;s box; and as soon as he was alone the unfortunate
New-Englander nosed all the cracks and openings with the most
passionate attention.&nbsp; But the weather was cool, and the
trunk still managed to contain his shocking secret.</p>
<p>He took a chair beside it, and buried his face in his hands,
and his mind in the most profound reflection.&nbsp; If he were
not speedily relieved, no question but he must be speedily
discovered.&nbsp; Alone in a strange city, without friends or
accomplices, if the Doctor&rsquo;s introduction failed him, he
was indubitably a lost New-Englander.&nbsp; He reflected
pathetically over his ambitious designs for the future; he should
not now become the hero and spokesman of his native place of
Bangor, Maine; he should not, as he had fondly anticipated, move
on from office to office, from honour to honour; he might as well
divest himself at once of all hope of being acclaimed President
of the United States, and leaving behind him a statue, in the
worst possible style of art, to adorn the Capitol at
Washington.&nbsp; Here he was, chained to a dead Englishman
doubled up inside a Saratoga trunk; whom he must get rid of, or
perish from the rolls of national glory!</p>
<p>I should be afraid to chronicle the language employed by this
young man to the Doctor, to the murdered man, to Madame
Z&eacute;phyrine, to the boots of the hotel, to the
Prince&rsquo;s servants, and, in a word, to all who had been ever
so remotely connected with his horrible misfortune.</p>
<p>He slunk down to dinner about seven at night; but the yellow
coffee-room appalled him, the eyes of the other diners seemed to
rest on his with suspicion, and his mind remained upstairs with
the Saratoga trunk.&nbsp; When the waiter came to offer him
cheese, his nerves were already so much on edge that he leaped
half-way out of his chair and upset the remainder of a pint of
ale upon the table-cloth.</p>
<p>The fellow offered to show him to the smoking-room when he had
done; and although he would have much preferred to return at once
to his perilous treasure, he had not the courage to refuse, and
was shown downstairs to the black, gas-lit cellar, which formed,
and possibly still forms, the divan of the Craven Hotel.</p>
<p>Two very sad betting men were playing billiards, attended by a
moist, consumptive marker; and for the moment Silas imagined that
these were the only occupants of the apartment.&nbsp; But at the
next glance his eye fell upon a person smoking in the farthest
corner, with lowered eyes and a most respectable and modest
aspect.&nbsp; He knew at once that he had seen the face before;
and, in spite of the entire change of clothes, recognised the man
whom he had found seated on a post at the entrance to Box Court,
and who had helped him to carry the trunk to and from the
carriage.&nbsp; The New-Englander simply turned and ran, nor did
he pause until he had locked and bolted himself into his
bedroom.</p>
<p>There, all night long, a prey to the most terrible
imaginations, he watched beside the fatal boxful of dead
flesh.&nbsp; The suggestion of the boots that his trunk was full
of gold inspired him with all manner of new terrors, if he so
much as dared to close an eye; and the presence in the
smoking-room, and under an obvious disguise, of the loiterer from
Box Court convinced him that he was once more the centre of
obscure machinations.</p>
<p>Midnight had sounded some time, when, impelled by uneasy
suspicions, Silas opened his bedroom door and peered into the
passage.&nbsp; It was dimly illuminated by a single jet of gas;
and some distance off he perceived a man sleeping on the floor in
the costume of an hotel under-servant.&nbsp; Silas drew near the
man on tiptoe.&nbsp; He lay partly on his back, partly on his
side, and his right forearm concealed his face from
recognition.&nbsp; Suddenly, while the American was still bending
over him, the sleeper removed his arm and opened his eyes, and
Silas found himself once more face to face with the loiterer of
Box Court.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-night, sir,&rdquo; said the man, pleasantly.</p>
<p>But Silas was too profoundly moved to find an answer, and
regained his room in silence.</p>
<p>Towards morning, worn out by apprehension, he fell asleep on
his chair, with his head forward on the trunk.&nbsp; In spite of
so constrained an attitude and such a grisly pillow, his slumber
was sound and prolonged, and he was only awakened at a late hour
and by a sharp tapping at the door.</p>
<p>He hurried to open, and found the boots without.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the gentleman who called yesterday at Box
Court?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Silas, with a quaver, admitted that he had done so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then this note is for you,&rdquo; added the servant,
proffering a sealed envelope.</p>
<p>Silas tore it open, and found inside the words: &ldquo;Twelve
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was punctual to the hour; the trunk was carried before him
by several stout servants; and he was himself ushered into a
room, where a man sat warming himself before the fire with his
back towards the door.&nbsp; The sound of so many persons
entering and leaving, and the scraping of the trunk as it was
deposited upon the bare boards, were alike unable to attract the
notice of the occupant; and Silas stood waiting, in an agony of
fear, until he should deign to recognise his presence.</p>
<p>Perhaps five minutes had elapsed before the man turned
leisurely about, and disclosed the features of Prince Florizel of
Bohemia.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So, sir,&rdquo; he said, with great severity,
&ldquo;this is the manner in which you abuse my politeness.&nbsp;
You join yourselves to persons of condition, I perceive, for no
other purpose than to escape the consequences of your crimes; and
I can readily understand your embarrassment when I addressed
myself to you yesterday.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; cried Silas, &ldquo;I am innocent of
everything except misfortune.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And in a hurried voice, and with the greatest ingenuousness,
he recounted to the Prince the whole history of his calamity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see I have been mistaken,&rdquo; said his Highness,
when he had heard him to an end.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are no other
than a victim, and since I am not to punish you may be sure I
shall do my utmost to help.&nbsp; And now,&rdquo; he continued,
&ldquo;to business.&nbsp; Open your box at once, and let me see
what it contains.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas changed colour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I almost fear to look upon it,&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay,&rdquo; replied the Prince, &ldquo;have you not
looked at it already?&nbsp; This is a form of sentimentality to
be resisted.&nbsp; The sight of a sick man, whom we can still
help, should appeal more directly to the feelings than that of a
dead man who is equally beyond help or harm, love or
hatred.&nbsp; Nerve yourself, Mr. Scuddamore,&rdquo; and then,
seeing that Silas still hesitated, &ldquo;I do not desire to give
another name to my request,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>The young American awoke as if out of a dream, and with a
shiver of repugnance addressed himself to loose the straps and
open the lock of the Saratoga trunk.&nbsp; The Prince stood by,
watching with a composed countenance and his hands behind his
back.&nbsp; The body was quite stiff, and it cost Silas a great
effort, both moral and physical, to dislodge it from its
position, and discover the face.</p>
<p>Prince Florizel started back with an exclamation of painful
surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;you little know, Mr.
Scuddamore, what a cruel gift you have brought me.&nbsp; This is
a young man of my own suite, the brother of my trusted friend;
and it was upon matters of my own service that he has thus
perished at the hands of violent and treacherous men.&nbsp; Poor
Geraldine,&rdquo; he went on, as if to himself, &ldquo;in what
words am I to tell you of your brother&rsquo;s fate?&nbsp; How
can I excuse myself in your eyes, or in the eyes of God, for the
presumptuous schemes that led him to this bloody and unnatural
death?&nbsp; Ah, Florizel! Florizel! when will you learn the
discretion that suits mortal life, and be no longer dazzled with
the image of power at your disposal?&nbsp; Power!&rdquo; he
cried; &ldquo;who is more powerless?&nbsp; I look upon this young
man whom I have sacrificed, Mr. Scuddamore, and feel how small a
thing it is to be a Prince.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas was moved at the sight of his emotion.&nbsp; He tried to
murmur some consolatory words, and burst into tears.</p>
<p>The Prince, touched by his obvious intention, came up to him
and took him by the hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Command yourself,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have
both much to learn, and we shall both be better men for
to-day&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas thanked him in silence with an affectionate look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Write me the address of Doctor Noel on this piece of
paper,&rdquo; continued the Prince, leading him towards the
table; &ldquo;and let me recommend you, when you are again in
Paris, to avoid the society of that dangerous man.&nbsp; He has
acted in this matter on a generous inspiration; that I must
believe; had he been privy to young Geraldine&rsquo;s death he
would never have despatched the body to the care of the actual
criminal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The actual criminal!&rdquo; repeated Silas in
astonishment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Even so,&rdquo; returned the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
letter, which the disposition of Almighty Providence has so
strangely delivered into my hands, was addressed to no less a
person than the criminal himself, the infamous President of the
Suicide Club.&nbsp; Seek to pry no further in these perilous
affairs, but content yourself with your own miraculous escape,
and leave this house at once.&nbsp; I have pressing affairs, and
must arrange at once about this poor clay, which was so lately a
gallant and handsome youth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Silas took a grateful and submissive leave of Prince Florizel,
but he lingered in Box Court until he saw him depart in a
splendid carriage on a visit to Colonel Henderson of the
police.&nbsp; Republican as he was, the young American took off
his hat with almost a sentiment of devotion to the retreating
carriage.&nbsp; And the same night he started by rail on his
return to Paris.</p>

<h3><a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 65</span>THE
ADVENTURE OF THE HANSOM CABS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich</span> had
greatly distinguished himself in one of the lesser Indian hill
wars.&nbsp; He it was who took the chieftain prisoner with his
own hand; his gallantry was universally applauded; and when he
came home, prostrated by an ugly sabre cut and a protracted
jungle fever, society was prepared to welcome the Lieutenant as a
celebrity of minor lustre.&nbsp; But his was a character
remarkable for unaffected modesty; adventure was dear to his
heart, but he cared little for adulation; and he waited at
foreign watering-places and in Algiers until the fame of his
exploits had run through its nine days&rsquo; vitality and begun
to be forgotten.&nbsp; He arrived in London at last, in the early
season, with as little observation as he could desire; and as he
was an orphan and had none but distant relatives who lived in the
provinces, it was almost as a foreigner that he installed himself
in the capital of the country for which he had shed his
blood.</p>
<p>On the day following his arrival he dined alone at a military
club.&nbsp; He shook hands with a few old comrades, and received
their warm congratulations; but as one and all had some
engagement for the evening, he found himself left entirely to his
own resources.&nbsp; He was in dress, for he had entertained the
notion of visiting a theatre.&nbsp; But the great city was new to
him; he had gone from a provincial school to a military college,
and thence direct to the Eastern Empire; and he promised himself
a variety of delights in this world for exploration.&nbsp;
Swinging his cane, he took his way westward.&nbsp; It was a mild
evening, already dark, and now and then threatening rain.&nbsp;
The succession of faces in the lamplight stirred the
Lieutenant&rsquo;s imagination; and it seemed to him as if he
could walk for ever in that stimulating city atmosphere and
surrounded by the mystery of four million private lives.&nbsp; He
glanced at the houses, and marvelled what was passing behind
those warmly-lighted windows; he looked into face after face, and
saw them each intent upon some unknown interest, criminal or
kindly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They talk of war,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;but this is
the great battlefield of mankind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then he began to wonder that he should walk so long in
this complicated scene, and not chance upon so much as the shadow
of an adventure for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in good time,&rdquo; he reflected.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am still a stranger, and perhaps wear a strange air.&nbsp; But I
must be drawn into the eddy before long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The night was already well advanced when a plump of cold rain
fell suddenly out of the darkness.&nbsp; Brackenbury paused under
some trees, and as he did so he caught sight of a hansom cabman
making him a sign that he was disengaged.&nbsp; The circumstance
fell in so happily to the occasion that he at once raised his
cane in answer, and had soon ensconced himself in the London
gondola.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where to, sir?&rdquo; asked the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where you please,&rdquo; said Brackenbury.</p>
<p>And immediately, at a pace of surprising swiftness, the hansom
drove off through the rain into a maze of villas.&nbsp; One villa
was so like another, each with its front garden, and there was so
little to distinguish the deserted lamp-lit streets and crescents
through which the flying hansom took its way, that Brackenbury
soon lost all idea of direction.</p>
<p>He would have been tempted to believe that the cabman was
amusing himself by driving him round and round and in and out
about a small quarter, but there was something business-like in
the speed which convinced him of the contrary.&nbsp; The man had
an object in view, he was hastening towards a definite end; and
Brackenbury was at once astonished at the fellow&rsquo;s skill in
picking a way through such a labyrinth, and a little concerned to
imagine what was the occasion of his hurry.&nbsp; He had heard
tales of strangers falling ill in London.&nbsp; Did the driver
belong to some bloody and treacherous association? and was he
himself being whirled to a murderous death?</p>
<p>The thought had scarcely presented itself, when the cab swung
sharply round a corner and pulled up before the garden gate of a
villa in a long and wide road.&nbsp; The house was brilliantly
lighted up.&nbsp; Another hansom had just driven away, and
Brackenbury could see a gentleman being admitted at the front
door and received by several liveried servants.&nbsp; He was
surprised that the cabman should have stopped so immediately in
front of a house where a reception was being held; but he did not
doubt it was the result of accident, and sat placidly smoking
where he was, until he heard the trap thrown open over his
head.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here we are, sir,&rdquo; said the driver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here!&rdquo; repeated Brackenbury.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You told me to take you where I pleased, sir,&rdquo;
returned the man with a chuckle, &ldquo;and here we
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It struck Brackenbury that the voice was wonderfully smooth
and courteous for a man in so inferior a position; he remembered
the speed at which he had been driven; and now it occurred to him
that the hansom was more luxuriously appointed than the common
run of public conveyances.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask you to explain,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you mean to turn me out into the rain?&nbsp; My good
man, I suspect the choice is mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The choice is certainly yours,&rdquo; replied the
driver; &ldquo;but when I tell you all, I believe I know how a
gentleman of your figure will decide.&nbsp; There is a
gentlemen&rsquo;s party in this house.&nbsp; I do not know
whether the master be a stranger to London and without
acquaintances of his own; or whether he is a man of odd
notions.&nbsp; But certainly I was hired to kidnap single
gentlemen in evening dress, as many as I pleased, but military
officers by preference.&nbsp; You have simply to go in and say
that Mr. Morris invited you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you Mr. Morris?&rdquo; inquired the Lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no,&rdquo; replied the cabman.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr.
Morris is the person of the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not a common way of collecting guests,&rdquo;
said Brackenbury: &ldquo;but an eccentric man might very well
indulge the whim without any intention to offend.&nbsp; And
suppose that I refuse Mr. Morris&rsquo;s invitation,&rdquo; he
went on, &ldquo;what then?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My orders are to drive you back where I took you
from,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;and set out to look for
others up to midnight.&nbsp; Those who have no fancy for such an
adventure, Mr. Morris said, were not the guests for
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These words decided the Lieutenant on the spot.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all,&rdquo; he reflected, as he descended from
the hansom, &ldquo;I have not had long to wait for my
adventure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had hardly found footing on the side-walk, and was still
feeling in his pocket for the fare, when the cab swung about and
drove off by the way it came at the former break-neck
velocity.&nbsp; Brackenbury shouted after the man, who paid no
heed, and continued to drive away; but the sound of his voice was
overheard in the house, the door was again thrown open, emitting
a flood of light upon the garden, and a servant ran down to meet
him holding an umbrella.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The cabman has been paid,&rdquo; observed the servant
in a very civil tone; and he proceeded to escort Brackenbury
along the path and up the steps.&nbsp; In the hall several other
attendants relieved him of his hat, cane, and paletot, gave him a
ticket with a number in return, and politely hurried him up a
stair adorned with tropical flowers, to the door of an apartment
on the first storey.&nbsp; Here a grave butler inquired his name,
and announcing &ldquo;Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich,&rdquo; ushered
him into the drawing-room of the house.</p>
<p>A young man, slender and singularly handsome, came forward and
greeted him with an air at once courtly and affectionate.&nbsp;
Hundreds of candles, of the finest wax, lit up a room that was
perfumed, like the staircase, with a profusion of rare and
beautiful flowering shrubs.&nbsp; A side-table was loaded with
tempting viands.&nbsp; Several servants went to and fro with
fruits and goblets of champagne.&nbsp; The company was perhaps
sixteen in number, all men, few beyond the prime of life, and
with hardly an exception, of a dashing and capable
exterior.&nbsp; They were divided into two groups, one about a
roulette board, and the other surrounding a table at which one of
their number held a bank of baccarat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; thought Brackenbury, &ldquo;I am in a
private gambling saloon, and the cabman was a tout.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His eye had embraced the details, and his mind formed the
conclusion, while his host was still holding him by the hand; and
to him his looks returned from this rapid survey.&nbsp; At a
second view Mr. Morris surprised him still more than on the
first.&nbsp; The easy elegance of his manners, the distinction,
amiability, and courage that appeared upon his features, fitted
very ill with the Lieutenant&rsquo;s preconceptions on the
subject of the proprietor of a hell; and the tone of his
conversation seemed to mark him out for a man of position and
merit.&nbsp; Brackenbury found he had an instinctive liking for
his entertainer; and though he chid himself for the weakness, he
was unable to resist a sort of friendly attraction for Mr.
Morris&rsquo;s person and character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of you, Lieutenant Rich,&rdquo; said Mr.
Morris, lowering his tone; &ldquo;and believe me I am gratified
to make your acquaintance.&nbsp; Your looks accord with the
reputation that has preceded you from India.&nbsp; And if you
will forget for a while the irregularity of your presentation in
my house, I shall feel it not only an honour, but a genuine
pleasure besides.&nbsp; A man who makes a mouthful of barbarian
cavaliers,&rdquo; he added with a laugh, &ldquo;should not be
appalled by a breach of etiquette, however serious.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he led him towards the sideboard and pressed him to
partake of some refreshment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; the Lieutenant reflected,
&ldquo;this is one of the pleasantest fellows and, I do not
doubt, one of the most agreeable societies in London.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He partook of some champagne, which he found excellent; and
observing that many of the company were already smoking, he lit
one of his own Manillas, and strolled up to the roulette board,
where he sometimes made a stake and sometimes looked on smilingly
on the fortune of others.&nbsp; It was while he was thus idling
that he became aware of a sharp scrutiny to which the whole of
the guests were subjected.&nbsp; Mr. Morris went here and there,
ostensibly busied on hospitable concerns; but he had ever a
shrewd glance at disposal; not a man of the party escaped his
sudden, searching looks; he took stock of the bearing of heavy
losers, he valued the amount of the stakes, he paused behind
couples who were deep in conversation; and, in a word, there was
hardly a characteristic of any one present but he seemed to catch
and make a note of it.&nbsp; Brackenbury began to wonder if this
were indeed a gambling hell: it had so much the air of a private
inquisition.&nbsp; He followed Mr. Morris in all his movements;
and although the man had a ready smile, he seemed to perceive, as
it were under a mask, a haggard, careworn, and preoccupied
spirit.&nbsp; The fellows around him laughed and made their game;
but Brackenbury had lost interest in the guests.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This Morris,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;is no idler in
the room.&nbsp; Some deep purpose inspires him; let it be mine to
fathom it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now and then Mr. Morris would call one of his visitors aside;
and after a brief colloquy in an ante-room, he would return
alone, and the visitors in question reappeared no more.&nbsp;
After a certain number of repetitions, this performance excited
Brackenbury&rsquo;s curiosity to a high degree.&nbsp; He
determined to be at the bottom of this minor mystery at once; and
strolling into the ante-room, found a deep window recess
concealed by curtains of the fashionable green.&nbsp; Here he
hurriedly ensconced himself; nor had he to wait long before the
sound of steps and voices drew near him from the principal
apartment.&nbsp; Peering through the division, he saw Mr. Morris
escorting a fat and ruddy personage, with somewhat the look of a
commercial traveller, whom Brackenbury had already remarked for
his coarse laugh and under-bred behaviour at the table.&nbsp; The
pair halted immediately before the window, so that Brackenbury
lost not a word of the following discourse:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg you a thousand pardons!&rdquo; began Mr. Morris,
with the most conciliatory manner; &ldquo;and, if I appear rude,
I am sure you will readily forgive me.&nbsp; In a place so great
as London accidents must continually happen; and the best that we
can hope is to remedy them with as small delay as possible.&nbsp;
I will not deny that I fear you have made a mistake and honoured
my poor house by inadvertence; for, to speak openly, I cannot at
all remember your appearance.&nbsp; Let me put the question
without unnecessary circumlocution&mdash;between gentlemen of
honour a word will suffice&mdash;Under whose roof do you suppose
yourself to be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That of Mr. Morris,&rdquo; replied the other, with a
prodigious display of confusion, which had been visibly growing
upon him throughout the last few words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. John or Mr. James Morris?&rdquo; inquired the
host.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I really cannot tell you,&rdquo; returned the
unfortunate guest.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not personally acquainted
with the gentleman, any more than I am with yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; said Mr. Morris.&nbsp; &ldquo;There is
another person of the same name farther down the street; and I
have no doubt the policeman will be able to supply you with his
number.&nbsp; Believe me, I felicitate myself on the
misunderstanding which has procured me the pleasure of your
company for so long; and let me express a hope that we may meet
again upon a more regular footing.&nbsp; Meantime, I would not
for the world detain you longer from your friends.&nbsp;
John,&rdquo; he added, raising his voice, &ldquo;will you see
that this gentleman finds his great-coat?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with the most agreeable air Mr. Morris escorted his
visitor as far as the ante-room door, where he left him under
conduct of the butler.&nbsp; As he passed the window, on his
return to the drawing-room, Brackenbury could hear him utter a
profound sigh, as though his mind was loaded with a great
anxiety, and his nerves already fatigued with the task on which
he was engaged.</p>
<p>For perhaps an hour the hansoms kept arriving with such
frequency, that Mr. Morris had to receive a new guest for every
old one that he sent away, and the company preserved its number
undiminished.&nbsp; But towards the end of that time the arrivals
grew few and far between, and at length ceased entirely, while
the process of elimination was continued with unimpaired
activity.&nbsp; The drawing-room began to look empty: the
baccarat was discontinued for lack of a banker; more than one
person said good-night of his own accord, and was suffered to
depart without expostulation; and in the meanwhile Mr. Morris
redoubled in agreeable attentions to those who stayed
behind.&nbsp; He went from group to group and from person to
person with looks of the readiest sympathy and the most pertinent
and pleasing talk; he was not so much like a host as like a
hostess, and there was a feminine coquetry and condescension in
his manner which charmed the hearts of all.</p>
<p>As the guests grew thinner, Lieutenant Rich strolled for a
moment out of the drawing-room into the hall in quest of fresher
air.&nbsp; But he had no sooner passed the threshold of the
ante-chamber than he was brought to a dead halt by a discovery of
the most surprising nature.&nbsp; The flowering shrubs had
disappeared from the staircase; three large furniture waggons
stood before the garden gate; the servants were busy dismantling
the house upon all sides; and some of them had already donned
their great-coats and were preparing to depart.&nbsp; It was like
the end of a country ball, where everything has been supplied by
contract.&nbsp; Brackenbury had indeed some matter for
reflection.&nbsp; First, the guests, who were no real guests
after all, had been dismissed; and now the servants, who could
hardly be genuine servants, were actively dispersing.</p>
<p>&lsquo;&ldquo;Was the whole establishment a sham?&rdquo; he
asked himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;The mushroom of a single night which
should disappear before morning?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Watching a favourable opportunity, Brackenbury dashed upstairs
to the highest regions of the house.&nbsp; It was as he had
expected.&nbsp; He ran from room to room, and saw not a stick of
furniture nor so much as a picture on the walls.&nbsp; Although
the house had been painted and papered, it was not only
uninhabited at present, but plainly had never been inhabited at
all.&nbsp; The young officer remembered with astonishment its
specious, settled, and hospitable air on his arrival.&nbsp; It
was only at a prodigious cost that the imposture could have been
carried out upon so great a scale.</p>
<p>Who, then, was Mr. Morris?&nbsp; What was his intention in
thus playing the householder for a single night in the remote
west of London?&nbsp; And why did he collect his visitors at
hazard from the streets?</p>
<p>Brackenbury remembered that he had already delayed too long,
and hastened to join the company.&nbsp; Many had left during his
absence; and counting the Lieutenant and his host, there were not
more than five persons in the drawing-room&mdash;recently so
thronged.&nbsp; Mr. Morris greeted him, as he re-entered the
apartment, with a smile, and immediately rose to his feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now time, gentlemen,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;to
explain my purpose in decoying you from your amusements.&nbsp; I
trust you did not find the evening hang very dully on your hands;
but my object, I will confess it, was not to entertain your
leisure, but to help myself in an unfortunate necessity.&nbsp;
You are all gentlemen,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;your
appearance does you that much justice, and I ask for no better
security.&nbsp; Hence, I speak it without concealment, I ask you
to render me a dangerous and delicate service; dangerous because
you may run the hazard of your lives, and delicate because I must
ask an absolute discretion upon all that you shall see or
hear.&nbsp; From an utter stranger the request is almost
comically extravagant; I am well aware of this; and I would add
at once, if there be any one present who has heard enough, if
there be one among the party who recoils from a dangerous
confidence and a piece of Quixotic devotion to he knows not
whom&mdash;here is my hand ready, and I shall wish him good-night
and God-speed with all the sincerity in the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A very tall, black man, with a heavy stoop, immediately
responded to this appeal.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I commend your frankness, Sir,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and, for my part, I go.&nbsp; I make no reflections; but I
cannot deny that you fill me with suspicious thoughts.&nbsp; I go
myself, as I say; and perhaps you will think I have no right to
add words to my example.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary,&rdquo; replied Mr. Morris, &ldquo;I am
obliged to you for all you say.&nbsp; It would be impossible to
exaggerate the gravity of my proposal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, gentlemen, what do you say?&rdquo; said the tall
man, addressing the others.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have had our
evening&rsquo;s frolic; shall we all go homeward peaceably in a
body?&nbsp; You will think well of my suggestion in the morning,
when you see the sun again in innocence and safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The speaker pronounced the last words with an intonation which
added to their force; and his face wore a singular expression,
full of gravity and significance.&nbsp; Another of the company
rose hastily, and, with some appearance of alarm, prepared to
take his leave.&nbsp; There were only two who held their ground,
Brackenbury and an old red-nosed cavalry Major; but these two
preserved a nonchalant demeanour, and, beyond a look of
intelligence which they rapidly exchanged, appeared entirely
foreign to the discussion that had just been terminated.</p>
<p>Mr. Morris conducted the deserters as far as the door, which
he closed upon their heels; then he turned round, disclosing a
countenance of mingled relief and animation, and addressed the
two officers as follows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have chosen my men like Joshua in the Bible,&rdquo;
said Mr. Morris, &ldquo;and I now believe I have the pick of
London.&nbsp; Your appearance pleased my hansom cabmen; then it
delighted me; I have watched your behaviour in a strange company,
and under the most unusual circumstances: I have studied how you
played and how you bore your losses; lastly, I have put you to
the test of a staggering announcement, and you received it like
an invitation to dinner.&nbsp; It is not for nothing,&rdquo; he
cried, &ldquo;that I have been for years the companion and the
pupil of the bravest and wisest potentate in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the affair of Bunderchang,&rdquo; observed the
Major, &ldquo;I asked for twelve volunteers, and every trooper in
the ranks replied to my appeal.&nbsp; But a gaming party is not
the same thing as a regiment under fire.&nbsp; You may be
pleased, I suppose, to have found two, and two who will not fail
you at a push.&nbsp; As for the pair who ran away, I count them
among the most pitiful hounds I ever met with.&nbsp; Lieutenant
Rich,&rdquo; he added, addressing Brackenbury, &ldquo;I have
heard much of you of late; and I cannot doubt but you have also
heard of me.&nbsp; I am Major O&rsquo;Rooke.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the veteran tendered his hand, which was red and
tremulous, to the young Lieutenant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who has not?&rdquo; answered Brackenbury.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When this little matter is settled,&rdquo; said Mr.
Morris, &ldquo;you will think I have sufficiently rewarded you;
for I could offer neither a more valuable service than to make
him acquainted with the other.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said Major O&rsquo;Rooke, &ldquo;is it
a duel?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A duel after a fashion,&rdquo; replied Mr. Morris,
&ldquo;a duel with unknown and dangerous enemies, and, as I
gravely fear, a duel to the death.&nbsp; I must ask you,&rdquo;
he continued, &ldquo;to call me Morris no longer; call me, if you
please, Hammersmith; my real name, as well as that of another
person to whom I hope to present you before long, you will
gratify me by not asking and not seeking to discover for
yourselves.&nbsp; Three days ago the person of whom I speak
disappeared suddenly from home; and, until this morning, I
received no hint of his situation.&nbsp; You will fancy my alarm
when I tell you that he is engaged upon a work of private
justice.&nbsp; Bound by an unhappy oath, too lightly sworn, he
finds it necessary, without the help of law, to rid the earth of
an insidious and bloody villain.&nbsp; Already two of our
friends, and one of them my own born brother, have perished in
the enterprise.&nbsp; He himself, or I am much deceived, is taken
in the same fatal toils.&nbsp; But at least he still lives and
still hopes, as this billet sufficiently proves.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the speaker, no other than Colonel Geraldine, proffered a
letter, thus conceived:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;<span class="smcap">Major
Hammersmith</span>,&mdash;On Wednesday, at 3 <span
class="GutSmall">A.M.</span>, you will be admitted by the small
door to the gardens of Rochester House, Regent&rsquo;s Park, by a
man who is entirely in my interest.&nbsp; I must request you not
to fail me by a second.&nbsp; Pray bring my case of swords, and,
if you can find them, one or two gentlemen of conduct and
discretion to whom my person is unknown.&nbsp; My name must not
be used in this affair.</p>
<p style="text-align: right">T. <span
class="smcap">Godall</span>.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;From his wisdom alone, if he had no other title,&rdquo;
pursued Colonel Geraldine, when the others had each satisfied his
curiosity, &ldquo;my friend is a man whose directions should
implicitly be followed.&nbsp; I need not tell you, therefore,
that I have not so much as visited the neighbourhood of Rochester
House; and that I am still as wholly in the dark as either of
yourselves as to the nature of my friend&rsquo;s dilemma.&nbsp; I
betook myself, as soon as I had received this order, to a
furnishing contractor, and, in a few hours, the house in which we
now are had assumed its late air of festival.&nbsp; My scheme was
at least original; and I am far from regretting an action which
has procured me the services of Major O&rsquo;Rooke and
Lieutenant Brackenbury Rich.&nbsp; But the servants in the street
will have a strange awakening.&nbsp; The house which this evening
was full of lights and visitors they will find uninhabited and
for sale to-morrow morning.&nbsp; Thus even the most serious
concerns,&rdquo; added the Colonel, &ldquo;have a merry
side.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And let us add a merry ending,&rdquo; said
Brackenbury.</p>
<p>The Colonel consulted his watch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is now hard on two,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;We
have an hour before us, and a swift cab is at the door.&nbsp;
Tell me if I may count upon your help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;During a long life,&rdquo; replied Major O&rsquo;Rooke,
&ldquo;I never took back my hand from anything, nor so much as
hedged a bet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Brackenbury signified his readiness in the most becoming
terms; and after they had drunk a glass or two of wine, the
Colonel gave each of them a loaded revolver, and the three
mounted into the cab and drove off for the address in
question.</p>
<p>Rochester House was a magnificent residence on the banks of
the canal.&nbsp; The large extent of the garden isolated it in an
unusual degree from the annoyances of neighbourhood.&nbsp; It
seemed the <i>parc aux cerfs</i> of some great nobleman or
millionaire.&nbsp; As far as could be seen from the street, there
was not a glimmer of light in any of the numerous windows of the
mansion; and the place had a look of neglect, as though the
master had been long from home.</p>
<p>The cab was discharged, and the three gentlemen were not long
in discovering the small door, which was a sort of postern in a
lane between two garden walls.&nbsp; It still wanted ten or
fifteen minutes of the appointed time; the rain fell heavily, and
the adventurers sheltered themselves below some pendant ivy, and
spoke in low tones of the approaching trial.</p>
<p>Suddenly Geraldine raised his finger to command silence, and
all three bent their hearing to the utmost.&nbsp; Through the
continuous noise of the rain, the steps and voices of two men
became audible from the other side of the wall; and, as they drew
nearer, Brackenbury, whose sense of hearing was remarkably acute,
could even distinguish some fragments of their talk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is the grave dug?&rdquo; asked one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; replied the other; &ldquo;behind the
laurel hedge.&nbsp; When the job is done, we can cover it with a
pile of stakes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The first speaker laughed, and the sound of his merriment was
shocking to the listeners on the other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In an hour from now,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>And by the sound of the steps it was obvious that the pair had
separated, and were proceeding in contrary directions.</p>
<p>Almost immediately after the postern door was cautiously
opened, a white face was protruded into the lane, and a hand was
seen beckoning to the watchers.&nbsp; In dead silence the three
passed the door, which was immediately locked behind them, and
followed their guide through several garden alleys to the kitchen
entrance of the house.&nbsp; A single candle burned in the great
paved kitchen, which was destitute of the customary furniture;
and as the party proceeded to ascend from thence by a flight of
winding stairs, a prodigious noise of rats testified still more
plainly to the dilapidation of the house.</p>
<p>Their conductor preceded them, carrying the candle.&nbsp; He
was a lean man, much bent, but still agile; and he turned from
time to time and admonished silence and caution by his
gestures.&nbsp; Colonel Geraldine followed on his heels, the case
of swords under one arm, and a pistol ready in the other.&nbsp;
Brackenbury&rsquo;s heart beat thickly.&nbsp; He perceived that
they were still in time; but he judged from the alacrity of the
old man that the hour of action must be near at hand; and the
circumstances of this adventure were so obscure and menacing, the
place seemed so well chosen for the darkest acts, that an older
man than Brackenbury might have been pardoned a measure of
emotion as he closed the procession up the winding stair.</p>
<p>At the top the guide threw open a door and ushered the three
officers before him into a small apartment, lighted by a smoky
lamp and the glow of a modest fire.&nbsp; At the chimney corner
sat a man in the early prime of life, and of a stout but courtly
and commanding appearance.&nbsp; His attitude and expression were
those of the most unmoved composure; he was smoking a cheroot
with much enjoyment and deliberation, and on a table by his elbow
stood a long glass of some effervescing beverage which diffused
an agreeable odour through the room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Welcome,&rdquo; said he, extending his hand to Colonel
Geraldine.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew I might count on your
exactitude.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On my devotion,&rdquo; replied the Colonel, with a
bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Present me to your friends,&rdquo; continued the first;
and, when that ceremony had been performed, &ldquo;I wish,
gentlemen,&rdquo; he added, with the most exquisite affability,
&ldquo;that I could offer you a more cheerful programme; it is
ungracious to inaugurate an acquaintance upon serious affairs;
but the compulsion of events is stronger than the obligations of
good-fellowship.&nbsp; I hope and believe you will be able to
forgive me this unpleasant evening; and for men of your stamp it
will be enough to know that you are conferring a considerable
favour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; said the Major, &ldquo;must
pardon my bluntness.&nbsp; I am unable to hide what I know.&nbsp;
For some time back I have suspected Major Hammersmith, but Mr.
Godall is unmistakable.&nbsp; To seek two men in London
unacquainted with Prince Florizel of Bohemia was to ask too much
at Fortune&rsquo;s hands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Prince Florizel!&rdquo; cried Brackenbury in
amazement.</p>
<p>And he gazed with the deepest interest on the features of the
celebrated personage before him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall not lament the loss of my incognito,&rdquo;
remarked the Prince, &ldquo;for it enables me to thank you with
the more authority.&nbsp; You would have done as much for Mr.
Godall, I feel sure, as for the Prince of Bohemia; but the latter
can perhaps do more for you.&nbsp; The gain is mine,&rdquo; he
added, with a courteous gesture.</p>
<p>And the next moment he was conversing with the two officers
about the Indian army and the native troops, a subject on which,
as on all others, he had a remarkable fund of information and the
soundest views.</p>
<p>There was something so striking in this man&rsquo;s attitude
at a moment of deadly peril that Brackenbury was overcome with
respectful admiration; nor was he less sensible to the charm of
his conversation or the surprising amenity of his address.&nbsp;
Every gesture, every intonation, was not only noble in itself,
but seemed to ennoble the fortunate mortal for whom it was
intended; and Brackenbury confessed to himself with enthusiasm
that this was a sovereign for whom a brave man might thankfully
lay down his life.</p>
<p>Many minutes had thus passed, when the person who had
introduced them into the house, and who had sat ever since in a
corner, and with his watch in his hand, arose and whispered a
word into the Prince&rsquo;s ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well, Dr. Noel,&rdquo; replied Florizel, aloud;
and then addressing the others, &ldquo;You will excuse me,
gentlemen,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;if I have to leave you in the
dark.&nbsp; The moment now approaches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Noel extinguished the lamp.&nbsp; A faint, grey light,
premonitory of the dawn, illuminated the window, but was not
sufficient to illuminate the room; and when the Prince rose to
his feet, it was impossible to distinguish his features or to
make a guess at the nature of the emotion which obviously
affected him as he spoke.&nbsp; He moved towards the door, and
placed himself at one side of it in an attitude of the wariest
attention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will have the kindness,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to
maintain the strictest silence, and to conceal yourselves in the
densest of the shadow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The three officers and the physician hastened to obey, and for
nearly ten minutes the only sound in Rochester House was
occasioned by the excursions of the rats behind the
woodwork.&nbsp; At the end of that period, a loud creak of a
hinge broke in with surprising distinctness on the silence; and
shortly after, the watchers could distinguish a slow and cautious
tread approaching up the kitchen stair.&nbsp; At every second
step the intruder seemed to pause and lend an ear, and during
these intervals, which seemed of an incalculable duration, a
profound disquiet possessed the spirit of the listeners.&nbsp;
Dr. Noel, accustomed as he was to dangerous emotions, suffered an
almost pitiful physical prostration; his breath whistled in his
lungs, his teeth grated one upon another, and his joints cracked
aloud as he nervously shifted his position.</p>
<p>At last a hand was laid upon the door, and the bolt shot back
with a slight report.&nbsp; There followed another pause, during
which Brackenbury could see the Prince draw himself together
noiselessly as if for some unusual exertion.&nbsp; Then the door
opened, letting in a little more of the light of the morning; and
the figure of a man appeared upon the threshold and stood
motionless.&nbsp; He was tall, and carried a knife in his
hand.&nbsp; Even in the twilight they could see his upper teeth
bare and glistening, for his mouth was open like that of a hound
about to leap.&nbsp; The man had evidently been over the head in
water but a minute or two before; and even while he stood there
the drops kept falling from his wet clothes and pattered on the
floor.</p>
<p>The next moment he crossed the threshold.&nbsp; There was a
leap, a stifled cry, an instantaneous struggle; and before
Colonel Geraldine could spring to his aid, the Prince held the
man disarmed and helpless, by the shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Dr. Noel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you will be so good as
to re-light the lamp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And relinquishing the charge of his prisoner to Geraldine and
Brackenbury, he crossed the room and set his back against the
chimney-piece.&nbsp; As soon as the lamp had kindled, the party
beheld an unaccustomed sternness on the Prince&rsquo;s
features.&nbsp; It was no longer Florizel, the careless
gentleman; it was the Prince of Bohemia, justly incensed and full
of deadly purpose, who now raised his head and addressed the
captive President of the Suicide Club.</p>
<p>&ldquo;President,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have laid your
last snare, and your own feet are taken in it.&nbsp; The day is
beginning; it is your last morning.&nbsp; You have just swum the
Regent&rsquo;s Canal; it is your last bathe in this world.&nbsp;
Your old accomplice, Dr. Noel, so far from betraying me, has
delivered you into my hands for judgment.&nbsp; And the grave you
had dug for me this afternoon shall serve, in God&rsquo;s
almighty providence, to hide your own just doom from the
curiosity of mankind.&nbsp; Kneel and pray, sir, if you have a
mind that way; for your time is short, and God is weary of your
iniquities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President made no answer either by word or sign; but
continued to hang his head and gaze sullenly on the floor, as
though he were conscious of the Prince&rsquo;s prolonged and
unsparing regard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; continued Florizel, resuming the
ordinary tone of his conversation, &ldquo;this is a fellow who
has long eluded me, but whom, thanks to Dr. Noel, I now have
tightly by the heels.&nbsp; To tell the story of his misdeeds
would occupy more time than we can now afford; but if the canal
had contained nothing but the blood of his victims, I believe the
wretch would have been no drier than you see him.&nbsp; Even in
an affair of this sort I desire to preserve the forms of
honour.&nbsp; But I make you the judges, gentlemen&mdash;this is
more an execution than a duel and to give the rogue his choice of
weapons would be to push too far a point of etiquette.&nbsp; I
cannot afford to lose my life in such a business,&rdquo; he
continued, unlocking the case of swords; &ldquo;and as a
pistol-bullet travels so often on the wings of chance, and skill
and courage may fall by the most trembling marksman, I have
decided, and I feel sure you will approve my determination, to
put this question to the touch of swords.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Brackenbury and Major O&rsquo;Rooke, to whom these
remarks were particularly addressed, had each intimated his
approval, &ldquo;Quick, sir,&rdquo; added Prince Florizel to the
President, &ldquo;choose a blade and do not keep me waiting; I
have an impatience to be done with you for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>For the first time since he was captured and disarmed the
President raised his head, and it was plain that he began
instantly to pluck up courage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to be stand up?&rdquo; he asked eagerly,
&ldquo;and between you and me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I mean so far to honour you,&rdquo; replied the
Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come!&rdquo; cried the President.&nbsp; &ldquo;With
a fair field, who knows how things may happen?&nbsp; I must add
that I consider it handsome behaviour on your Highness&rsquo;s
part; and if the worst comes to the worst I shall die by one of
the most gallant gentlemen in Europe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the President, liberated by those who had detained him,
stepped up to the table and began, with minute attention, to
select a sword.&nbsp; He was highly elated, and seemed to feel no
doubt that he should issue victorious from the contest.&nbsp; The
spectators grew alarmed in the face of so entire a confidence,
and adjured Prince Florizel to reconsider his intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is but a farce,&rdquo; he answered; &ldquo;and I
think I can promise you, gentlemen, that it will not be long
a-playing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will be careful not to over-reach,&rdquo;
said Colonel Geraldine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Geraldine,&rdquo; returned the Prince, &ldquo;did you
ever know me fail in a debt of honour?&nbsp; I owe you this
man&rsquo;s death, and you shall have it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The President at last satisfied himself with one of the
rapiers, and signified his readiness by a gesture that was not
devoid of a rude nobility.&nbsp; The nearness of peril, and the
sense of courage, even to this obnoxious villain, lent an air of
manhood and a certain grace.</p>
<p>The Prince helped himself at random to a sword.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Colonel Geraldine and Doctor Noel,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;will have the goodness to await me in this room.&nbsp; I
wish no personal friend of mine to be involved in this
transaction.&nbsp; Major O&rsquo;Rooke, you are a man of some
years and a settled reputation&mdash;let me recommend the
President to your good graces.&nbsp; Lieutenant Rich will be so
good as lend me his attentions: a young man cannot have too much
experience in such affairs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; replied Brackenbury, &ldquo;it is
an honour I shall prize extremely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well,&rdquo; returned Prince Florizel; &ldquo;I
shall hope to stand your friend in more important
circumstances.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying he led the way out of the apartment and down the
kitchen stairs.</p>
<p>The two men who were thus left alone threw open the window and
leaned out, straining every sense to catch an indication of the
tragical events that were about to follow.&nbsp; The rain was now
over; day had almost come, and the birds were piping in the
shrubbery and on the forest trees of the garden.&nbsp; The Prince
and his companions were visible for a moment as they followed an
alley between two flowering thickets; but at the first corner a
clump of foliage intervened, and they were again concealed from
view.&nbsp; This was all that the Colonel and the Physician had
an opportunity to see, and the garden was so vast, and the place
of combat evidently so remote from the house, that not even the
noise of sword-play reached their ears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has taken him towards the grave,&rdquo; said Dr.
Noel, with a shudder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God,&rdquo; cried the Colonel, &ldquo;God defend the
right!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And they awaited the event in silence, the Doctor shaking with
fear, the Colonel in an agony of sweat.&nbsp; Many minutes must
have elapsed, the day was sensibly broader, and the birds were
singing more heartily in the garden before a sound of returning
footsteps recalled their glances towards the door.&nbsp; It was
the Prince and the two Indian officers who entered.&nbsp; God had
defended the right.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am ashamed of my emotion,&rdquo; said Prince
Florizel; &ldquo;I feel it is a weakness unworthy of my station,
but the continued existence of that hound of hell had begun to
prey upon me like a disease, and his death has more refreshed me
than a night of slumber.&nbsp; Look, Geraldine,&rdquo; he
continued, throwing his sword upon the floor, &ldquo;there is the
blood of the man who killed your brother.&nbsp; It should be a
welcome sight.&nbsp; And yet,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;see how
strangely we men are made! my revenge is not yet five minutes
old, and already I am beginning to ask myself if even revenge be
attainable on this precarious stage of life.&nbsp; The ill he
did, who can undo it?&nbsp; The career in which he amassed a huge
fortune (for the house itself in which we stand belonged to
him)&mdash;that career is now a part of the destiny of mankind
for ever; and I might weary myself making thrusts in carte until
the crack of judgment, and Geraldine&rsquo;s brother would be
none the less dead, and a thousand other innocent persons would
be none the less dishonoured and debauched!&nbsp; The existence
of a man is so small a thing to take, so mighty a thing to
employ!&nbsp; Alas!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;is there anything in
life so disenchanting as attainment?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God&rsquo;s justice has been done,&rdquo; replied the
Doctor.&nbsp; &ldquo;So much I behold.&nbsp; The lesson, your
Highness, has been a cruel one for me; and I await my own turn
with deadly apprehension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was I saying?&rdquo; cried the Prince. &ldquo;I
have punished, and here is the man beside us who can help me to
undo.&nbsp; Ah, Dr. Noel! you and I have before us many a day of
hard and honourable toil; and perhaps, before we have none, you
may have more than redeemed your early errors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; said the Doctor, &ldquo;let
me go and bury my oldest friend.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>THE RAJAH&rsquo;S DIAMOND</h2>
<h3><a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 88</span>STORY
OF THE BANDBOX</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Up</span> to the age of sixteen, at a
private school and afterwards at one of those great institutions
for which England is justly famous, Mr. Harry Hartley had
received the ordinary education of a gentleman.&nbsp; At that
period, he manifested a remarkable distaste for study; and his
only surviving parent being both weak and ignorant, he was
permitted thenceforward to spend his time in the attainment of
petty and purely elegant accomplishments.&nbsp; Two years later,
he was left an orphan and almost a beggar.&nbsp; For all active
and industrious pursuits, Harry was unfitted alike by nature and
training.&nbsp; He could sing romantic ditties, and accompany
himself with discretion on the piano; he was a graceful although
a timid cavalier; he had a pronounced taste for chess; and nature
had sent him into the world with one of the most engaging
exteriors that can well be fancied.&nbsp; Blond and pink, with
dove&rsquo;s eyes and a gentle smile, he had an air of agreeable
tenderness and melancholy, and the most submissive and caressing
manners.&nbsp; But when all is said, he was not the man to lead
armaments of war, or direct the councils of a State.</p>
<p>A fortunate chance and some influence obtained for Harry, at
the time of his bereavement, the position of private secretary to
Major-General Sir Thomas Vandeleur, C.B.&nbsp; Sir Thomas was a
man of sixty, loud-spoken, boisterous, and domineering.&nbsp; For
some reason, some service the nature of which had been often
whispered and repeatedly denied, the Rajah of Kashgar had
presented this officer with the sixth known diamond of the
world.&nbsp; The gift transformed General Vandeleur from a poor
into a wealthy man, from an obscure and unpopular soldier into
one of the lions of London society; the possessor of the
Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond was welcome in the most exclusive circles;
and he had found a lady, young, beautiful, and well-born, who was
willing to call the diamond hers even at the price of marriage
with Sir Thomas Vandeleur.&nbsp; It was commonly said at the time
that, as like draws to like, one jewel had attracted another;
certainly Lady Vandeleur was not only a gem of the finest water
in her own person, but she showed herself to the world in a very
costly setting; and she was considered by many respectable
authorities, as one among the three or four best dressed women in
England.</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s duty as secretary was not particularly onerous;
but he had a dislike for all prolonged work; it gave him pain to
ink his fingers; and the charms of Lady Vandeleur and her
toilettes drew him often from the library to the boudoir.&nbsp;
He had the prettiest ways among women, could talk fashions with
enjoyment, and was never more happy than when criticising a shade
of ribbon, or running on an errand to the milliner&rsquo;s.&nbsp;
In short, Sir Thomas&rsquo;s correspondence fell into pitiful
arrears, and my Lady had another lady&rsquo;s maid.</p>
<p>At last the General, who was one of the least patient of
military commanders, arose from his place in a violent access of
passion, and indicated to his secretary that he had no further
need for his services, with one of those explanatory gestures
which are most rarely employed between gentlemen.&nbsp; The door
being unfortunately open, Mr. Hartley fell downstairs head
foremost.</p>
<p>He arose somewhat hurt and very deeply aggrieved.&nbsp; The
life in the General&rsquo;s house precisely suited him; he moved,
on a more or less doubtful footing, in very genteel company, he
did little, he ate of the best, and he had a lukewarm
satisfaction in the presence of Lady Vandeleur, which, in his own
heart, he dubbed by a more emphatic name.</p>
<p>Immediately after he had been outraged by the military foot,
he hurried to the boudoir and recounted his sorrows.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know very well, my dear Harry,&rdquo; replied Lady
Vandeleur, for she called him by name like a child or a domestic
servant, &ldquo;that you never by any chance do what the General
tells you.&nbsp; No more do I, you may say.&nbsp; But that is
different.&nbsp; A woman can earn her pardon for a good year of
disobedience by a single adroit submission; and, besides, no one
is married to his private secretary.&nbsp; I shall be sorry to
lose you; but since you cannot stay longer in a house where you
have been insulted, I shall wish you good-bye, and I promise you
to make the General smart for his behaviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s countenance fell; tears came into his eyes, and
he gazed on Lady Vandeleur with a tender reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My Lady,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;what is an
insult?&nbsp; I should think little indeed of any one who could
not forgive them by the score.&nbsp; But to leave one&rsquo;s
friends; to tear up the bonds of affection&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was unable to continue, for his emotion choked him, and he
began to weep.</p>
<p>Lady Vandeleur looked at him with a curious expression.&nbsp;
&ldquo;This little fool,&rdquo; she thought, &ldquo;imagines
himself to be in love with me.&nbsp; Why should he not become my
servant instead of the General&rsquo;s?&nbsp; He is good-natured,
obliging, and understands dress; and besides it will keep him out
of mischief.&nbsp; He is positively too pretty to be
unattached.&rdquo;&nbsp; That night she talked over the General,
who was already somewhat ashamed of his vivacity; and Harry was
transferred to the feminine department, where his life was little
short of heavenly.&nbsp; He was always dressed with uncommon
nicety, wore delicate flowers in his button-hole, and could
entertain a visitor with tact and pleasantry.&nbsp; He took a
pride in servility to a beautiful woman; received Lady
Vandeleur&rsquo;s commands as so many marks of favour; and was
pleased to exhibit himself before other men, who derided and
despised him, in his character of male lady&rsquo;s-maid and man
milliner.&nbsp; Nor could he think enough of his existence from a
moral point of view.&nbsp; Wickedness seemed to him an
essentially male attribute, and to pass one&rsquo;s days with a
delicate woman, and principally occupied about trimmings, was to
inhabit an enchanted isle among the storms of life.</p>
<p>One fine morning he came into the drawing-room and began to
arrange some music on the top of the piano.&nbsp; Lady Vandeleur,
at the other end of the apartment, was speaking somewhat eagerly
with her brother, Charlie Pendragon, an elderly young man, much
broken with dissipation, and very lame of one foot.&nbsp; The
private secretary, to whose entrance they paid no regard, could
not avoid overhearing a part of their conversation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day or never,&rdquo; said the lady.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Once and for all, it shall be done to-day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To-day, if it must be,&rdquo; replied the brother, with
a sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;But it is a false step, a ruinous step,
Clara; and we shall live to repent it dismally.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Lady Vandeleur looked her brother steadily and somewhat
strangely in the face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You forget,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;the man must die at
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Clara,&rdquo; said Pendragon, &ldquo;I
believe you are the most heartless rascal in England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You men,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;are so coarsely
built, that you can never appreciate a shade of meaning.&nbsp;
You are yourselves rapacious, violent, immodest, careless of
distinction; and yet the least thought for the future shocks you
in a woman.&nbsp; I have no patience with such stuff.&nbsp; You
would despise in a common banker the imbecility that you expect
to find in us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very likely right,&rdquo; replied her brother;
&ldquo;you were always cleverer than I.&nbsp; And, anyway, you
know my motto: The family before all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Charlie,&rdquo; she returned, taking his hand in
hers, &ldquo;I know your motto better than you know it
yourself.&nbsp; &lsquo;And Clara before the family!&rsquo;&nbsp;
Is not that the second part of it?&nbsp; Indeed, you are the best
of brothers, and I love you dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Pendragon got up, looking a little confused by these
family endearments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had better not be seen,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I understand my part to a miracle, and I&rsquo;ll keep an
eye on the Tame Cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is an abject
creature, and might ruin all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She kissed the tips of her fingers to him daintily; and the
brother withdrew by the boudoir and the back stair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry,&rdquo; said Lady Vandeleur, turning towards the
secretary as soon as they were alone, &ldquo;I have a commission
for you this morning.&nbsp; But you shall take a cab; I cannot
have my secretary freckled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She spoke the last words with emphasis and a look of
half-motherly pride that caused great contentment to poor Harry;
and he professed himself charmed to find an opportunity of
serving her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is another of our great secrets,&rdquo; she went on
archly, &ldquo;and no one must know of it but my secretary and
me.&nbsp; Sir Thomas would make the saddest disturbance; and if
you only knew how weary I am of these scenes!&nbsp; Oh, Harry,
Harry, can you explain to me what makes you men so violent and
unjust?&nbsp; But, indeed, I know you cannot; you are the only
man in the world who knows nothing of these shameful passions;
you are so good, Harry, and so kind; you, at least, can be a
woman&rsquo;s friend; and, do you know?&nbsp; I think you make
the others more ugly by comparison.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you,&rdquo; said Harry gallantly, &ldquo;who are
so kind to me.&nbsp; You treat me like&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Like a mother,&rdquo; interposed Lady Vandeleur;
&ldquo;I try to be a mother to you.&nbsp; Or, at least,&rdquo;
she corrected herself with a smile, &ldquo;almost a mother.&nbsp;
I am afraid I am too young to be your mother really.&nbsp; Let us
say a friend&mdash;a dear friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused long enough to let her words take effect in
Harry&rsquo;s sentimental quarters, but not long enough to allow
him a reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all this is beside our purpose,&rdquo; she
resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;You will find a bandbox in the left-hand
side of the oak wardrobe; it is underneath the pink slip that I
wore on Wednesday with my Mechlin.&nbsp; You will take it
immediately to this address,&rdquo; and she gave him a paper,
&ldquo;but do not, on any account, let it out of your hands until
you have received a receipt written by myself.&nbsp; Do you
understand?&nbsp; Answer, if you please&mdash;answer!&nbsp; This
is extremely important, and I must ask you to pay some
attention.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry pacified her by repeating her instructions perfectly;
and she was just going to tell him more when General Vandeleur
flung into the apartment, scarlet with anger, and holding a long
and elaborate milliner&rsquo;s bill in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you look at this, madam?&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Will you have the goodness to look at this document?&nbsp;
I know well enough you married me for my money, and I hope I can
make as great allowances as any other man in the service; but, as
sure as God made me, I mean to put a period to this disreputable
prodigality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Hartley,&rdquo; said Lady Vandeleur, &ldquo;I think
you understand what you have to do.&nbsp; May I ask you to see to
it at once?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; said the General, addressing Harry,
&ldquo;one word before you go.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then, turning
again to Lady Vandeleur, &ldquo;What is this precious
fellow&rsquo;s errand?&rdquo; he demanded.&nbsp; &ldquo;I trust
him no further than I do yourself, let me tell you.&nbsp; If he
had as much as the rudiments of honesty, he would scorn to stay
in this house; and what he does for his wages is a mystery to all
the world.&nbsp; What is his errand, madam? and why are you
hurrying him away?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I supposed you had something to say to me in
private,&rdquo; replied the lady.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You spoke about an errand,&rdquo; insisted the
General.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not attempt to deceive me in my present
state of temper.&nbsp; You certainly spoke about an
errand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you insist on making your servants privy to our
humiliating dissensions,&rdquo; replied Lady Vandeleur,
&ldquo;perhaps I had better ask Mr. Hartley to sit down.&nbsp;
No?&rdquo; she continued; &ldquo;then you may go, Mr.
Hartley.&nbsp; I trust you may remember all that you have heard
in this room; it may be useful to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry at once made his escape from the drawing-room; and as he
ran upstairs he could hear the General&rsquo;s voice upraised in
declamation, and the thin tones of Lady Vandeleur planting icy
repartees at every opening.&nbsp; How cordially he admired the
wife!&nbsp; How skilfully she could evade an awkward question!
with what secure effrontery she repeated her instructions under
the very guns of the enemy! and on the other hand, how he
detested the husband!</p>
<p>There had been nothing unfamiliar in the morning&rsquo;s
events, for he was continually in the habit of serving Lady
Vandeleur on secret missions, principally connected with
millinery.&nbsp; There was a skeleton in the house, as he well
knew.&nbsp; The bottomless extravagance and the unknown
liabilities of the wife had long since swallowed her own fortune,
and threatened day by day to engulph that of the husband.&nbsp;
Once or twice in every year exposure and ruin seemed imminent,
and Harry kept trotting round to all sorts of furnishers&rsquo;
shops, telling small fibs, and paying small advances on the gross
amount, until another term was tided over, and the lady and her
faithful secretary breathed again.&nbsp; For Harry, in a double
capacity, was heart and soul upon that side of the war: not only
did he adore Lady Vandeleur and fear and dislike her husband, but
he naturally sympathised with the love of finery, and his own
single extravagance was at the tailor&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>He found the bandbox where it had been described, arranged his
toilette with care, and left the house.&nbsp; The sun shone
brightly; the distance he had to travel was considerable, and he
remembered with dismay that the General&rsquo;s sudden irruption
had prevented Lady Vandeleur from giving him money for a
cab.&nbsp; On this sultry day there was every chance that his
complexion would suffer severely; and to walk through so much of
London with a bandbox on his arm was a humiliation almost
insupportable to a youth of his character.&nbsp; He paused, and
took counsel with himself.&nbsp; The Vandeleurs lived in Eaton
Place; his destination was near Notting Hill; plainly, he might
cross the Park by keeping well in the open and avoiding populous
alleys; and he thanked his stars when he reflected that it was
still comparatively early in the day.</p>
<p>Anxious to be rid of his incubus, he walked somewhat faster
than his ordinary, and he was already some way through Kensington
Gardens when, in a solitary spot among trees, he found himself
confronted by the General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas,&rdquo; observed Harry,
politely falling on one side; for the other stood directly in his
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where are you going, sir?&rdquo; asked the General.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am taking a little walk among the trees,&rdquo;
replied the lad.</p>
<p>The General struck the bandbox with his cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With that thing?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;you lie, sir,
and you know you lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, Sir Thomas,&rdquo; returned Harry, &ldquo;I am
not accustomed to be questioned in so high a key.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand your position,&rdquo; said the
General.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are my servant, and a servant of whom I
have conceived the most serious suspicions.&nbsp; How do I know
but that your box is full of teaspoons?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It contains a silk hat belonging to a friend,&rdquo;
said Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; replied General Vandeleur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then I want to see your friend&rsquo;s silk hat.&nbsp; I
have,&rdquo; he added grimly, &ldquo;a singular curiosity for
hats; and I believe you know me to be somewhat
positive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon, Sir Thomas, I am exceedingly
grieved,&rdquo; Harry apologised; &ldquo;but indeed this is a
private affair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General caught him roughly by the shoulder with one hand,
while he raised his cane in the most menacing manner with the
other.&nbsp; Harry gave himself up for lost; but at the same
moment Heaven vouchsafed him an unexpected defender in the person
of Charlie Pendragon, who now strode forward from behind the
trees.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, General, hold your hand,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;this is neither courteous nor manly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; cried the General, wheeling round upon his
new antagonist, &ldquo;Mr. Pendragon!&nbsp; And do you suppose,
Mr. Pendragon, that because I have had the misfortune to marry
your sister, I shall suffer myself to be dogged and thwarted by a
discredited and bankrupt libertine like you?&nbsp; My
acquaintance with Lady Vandeleur, sir, has taken away all my
appetite for the other members of her family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you fancy, General Vandeleur,&rdquo; retorted
Charlie, &ldquo;that because my sister has had the misfortune to
marry you, she there and then forfeited her rights and privileges
as a lady?&nbsp; I own, sir, that by that action she did as much
as anybody could to derogate from her position; but to me she is
still a Pendragon.&nbsp; I make it my business to protect her
from ungentlemanly outrage, and if you were ten times her husband
I would not permit her liberty to be restrained, nor her private
messengers to be violently arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How is that, Mr. Hartley?&rdquo; interrogated the
General.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Pendragon is of my opinion, it
appears.&nbsp; He too suspects that Lady Vandeleur has something
to do with your friend&rsquo;s silk hat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Charlie saw that he had committed an unpardonable blunder,
which he hastened to repair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How, sir?&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;I suspect, do you
say?&nbsp; I suspect nothing.&nbsp; Only where I find strength
abused and a man brutalising his inferiors, I take the liberty to
interfere.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he said these words he made a sign to Harry, which the
latter was too dull or too much troubled to understand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In what way am I to construe your attitude, sir?&rdquo;
demanded Vandeleur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, sir, as you please,&rdquo; returned Pendragon.</p>
<p>The General once more raised his cane, and made a cut for
Charlie&rsquo;s head; but the latter, lame foot and all, evaded
the blow with his umbrella, ran in, and immediately closed with
his formidable adversary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Run, Harry, run!&rdquo; he cried; &ldquo;run, you
dolt!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry stood petrified for a moment, watching the two men sway
together in this fierce embrace; then he turned and took to his
heels.&nbsp; When he cast a glance over his shoulder he saw the
General prostrate under Charlie&rsquo;s knee, but still making
desperate efforts to reverse the situation; and the Gardens
seemed to have filled with people, who were running from all
directions towards the scene of fight.&nbsp; This spectacle lent
the secretary wings; and he did not relax his pace until he had
gained the Bayswater road, and plunged at random into an
unfrequented by-street.</p>
<p>To see two gentlemen of his acquaintance thus brutally mauling
each other was deeply shocking to Harry.&nbsp; He desired to
forget the sight; he desired, above all, to put as great a
distance as possible between himself and General Vandeleur; and
in his eagerness for this he forgot everything about his
destination, and hurried before him headlong and trembling.&nbsp;
When he remembered that Lady Vandeleur was the wife of one and
the sister of the other of these gladiators, his heart was
touched with sympathy for a woman so distressingly misplaced in
life.&nbsp; Even his own situation in the General&rsquo;s
household looked hardly so pleasing as usual in the light of
these violent transactions.</p>
<p>He had walked some little distance, busied with these
meditations, before a slight collision with another passenger
reminded him of the bandbox on his arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;where was my head? and
whither have I wandered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Thereupon he consulted the envelope which Lady Vandeleur had
given him.&nbsp; The address was there, but without a name.&nbsp;
Harry was simply directed to ask for &ldquo;the gentleman who
expected a parcel from Lady Vandeleur,&rdquo; and if he were not
at home to await his return.&nbsp; The gentleman, added the note,
should present a receipt in the handwriting of the lady
herself.&nbsp; All this seemed mightily mysterious, and Harry was
above all astonished at the omission of the name and the
formality of the receipt.&nbsp; He had thought little of this
last when he heard it dropped in conversation; but reading it in
cold blood, and taking it in connection with the other strange
particulars, he became convinced that he was engaged in perilous
affairs.&nbsp; For half a moment he had a doubt of Lady Vandeleur
herself; for he found these obscure proceedings somewhat unworthy
of so high a lady, and became more critical when her secrets were
preserved against himself.&nbsp; But her empire over his spirit
was too complete, he dismissed his suspicions, and blamed himself
roundly for having so much as entertained them.</p>
<p>In one thing, however, his duty and interest, his generosity
and his terrors, coincided&mdash;to get rid of the bandbox with
the greatest possible despatch.</p>
<p>He accosted the first policeman and courteously inquired his
way.&nbsp; It turned out that he was already not far from his
destination, and a walk of a few minutes brought him to a small
house in a lane, freshly painted, and kept with the most
scrupulous attention.&nbsp; The knocker and bell-pull were highly
polished; flowering pot-herbs garnished the sills of the
different windows; and curtains of some rich material concealed
the interior from the eyes of curious passengers.&nbsp; The place
had an air of repose and secrecy; and Harry was so far caught
with this spirit that he knocked with more than usual discretion,
and was more than usually careful to remove all impurity from his
boots.</p>
<p>A servant-maid of some personal attractions immediately opened
the door, and seemed to regard the secretary with no unkind
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is the parcel from Lady Vandeleur,&rdquo; said
Harry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; replied the maid, with a nod.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But the gentleman is from home.&nbsp; Will you leave it
with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot,&rdquo; answered Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
directed not to part with it but upon a certain condition, and I
must ask you, I am afraid, to let me wait.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;I suppose I may let you
wait.&nbsp; I am lonely enough, I can tell you, and you do not
look as though you would eat a girl.&nbsp; But be sure and do not
ask the gentleman&rsquo;s name, for that I am not to tell
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you say so?&rdquo; cried Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why,
how strange!&nbsp; But indeed for some time back I walk among
surprises.&nbsp; One question I think I may surely ask without
indiscretion: Is he the master of this house?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a lodger, and not eight days old at that,&rdquo;
returned the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now a question for a
question: Do you know lady Vandeleur?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am her private secretary,&rdquo; replied Harry with a
glow of modest pride.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is pretty, is she not?&rdquo; pursued the
servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, beautiful!&rdquo; cried Harry; &ldquo;wonderfully
lovely, and not less good and kind!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You look kind enough yourself,&rdquo; she retorted;
&ldquo;and I wager you are worth a dozen Lady
Vandeleurs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry was properly scandalised.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am only a
secretary!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that for me?&rdquo; said the girl.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Because I am only a housemaid, if you please.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then, relenting at the sight of Harry&rsquo;s obvious
confusion, &ldquo;I know you mean nothing of the sort,&rdquo; she
added; &ldquo;and I like your looks; but I think nothing of your
Lady Vandeleur.&nbsp; Oh, these mistresses!&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;To send out a real gentleman like
you&mdash;with a bandbox&mdash;in broad day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>During this talk they had remained in their original
positions&mdash;she on the doorstep, he on the side-walk,
bareheaded for the sake of coolness, and with the bandbox on his
arm.&nbsp; But upon this last speech Harry, who was unable to
support such point-blank compliments to his appearance, nor the
encouraging look with which they were accompanied, began to
change his attitude, and glance from left to right in
perturbation.&nbsp; In so doing he turned his face towards the
lower end of the lane, and there, to his indescribable dismay,
his eyes encountered those of General Vandeleur.&nbsp; The
General, in a prodigious fluster of heat, hurry, and indignation,
had been scouring the streets in chase of his brother-in-law; but
so soon as he caught a glimpse of the delinquent secretary, his
purpose changed, his anger flowed into a new channel, and he
turned on his heel and came tearing up the lane with truculent
gestures and vociferations.</p>
<p>Harry made but one bolt of it into the house, driving the maid
before him; and the door was slammed in his pursuer&rsquo;s
countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there a bar?&nbsp; Will it lock?&rdquo; asked Harry,
while a salvo on the knocker made the house echo from wall to
wall.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, what is wrong with you?&rdquo; asked the
maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it this old gentleman?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If he gets hold of me,&rdquo; whispered Harry, &ldquo;I
am as good as dead.&nbsp; He has been pursuing me all day,
carries a sword-stick, and is an Indian military
officer.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These are fine manners,&rdquo; cried the maid.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And what, if you please, may be his name?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the General, my master,&rdquo; answered
Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is after this bandbox.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Did not I tell you?&rdquo; cried the maid in
triumph.&nbsp; &ldquo;I told you I thought worse than nothing of
your Lady Vandeleur; and if you had an eye in your head you might
see what she is for yourself.&nbsp; An ungrateful minx, I will be
bound for that!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The General renewed his attack upon the knocker, and his
passion growing with delay, began to kick and beat upon the
panels of the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is lucky,&rdquo; observed the girl, &ldquo;that I am
alone in the house; your General may hammer until he is weary,
and there is none to open for him.&nbsp; Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying she led Harry into the kitchen, where she made him
sit down, and stood by him herself in an affectionate attitude,
with a hand upon his shoulder.&nbsp; The din at the door, so far
from abating, continued to increase in volume, and at each blow
the unhappy secretary was shaken to the heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo; asked the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Harry Hartley,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mine,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;is Prudence.&nbsp; Do
you like it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; said Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;But hear for
a moment how the General beats upon the door.&nbsp; He will
certainly break it in, and then, in heaven&rsquo;s name, what
have I to look for but death?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put yourself very much about with no
occasion,&rdquo; answered Prudence.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let your General
knock, he will do no more than blister his hands.&nbsp; Do you
think I would keep you here if I were not sure to save you?&nbsp;
Oh, no, I am a good friend to those that please me! and we have a
back door upon another lane.&nbsp; But,&rdquo; she added,
checking him, for he had got upon his feet immediately on this
welcome news, &ldquo;but I will not show where it is unless you
kiss me.&nbsp; Will you, Harry?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I will,&rdquo; he cried, remembering his
gallantry, &ldquo;not for your back door, but because you are
good and pretty.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he administered two or three cordial salutes, which were
returned to him in kind.</p>
<p>Then Prudence led him to the back gate, and put her hand upon
the key.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you come and see me?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will indeed,&rdquo; said Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do not I
owe you my life?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; she added, opening the door, &ldquo;run
as hard as you can, for I shall let in the General.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry scarcely required this advice; fear had him by the
forelock; and he addressed himself diligently to flight.&nbsp; A
few steps, and he believed he would escape from his trials, and
return to Lady Vandeleur in honour and safety.&nbsp; But these
few steps had not been taken before he heard a man&rsquo;s voice
hailing him by name with many execrations, and, looking over his
shoulder, he beheld Charlie Pendragon waving him with both arms
to return.&nbsp; The shock of this new incident was so sudden and
profound, and Harry was already worked into so high a state of
nervous tension, that he could think of nothing better than to
accelerate his pace, and continue running.&nbsp; He should
certainly have remembered the scene in Kensington Gardens; he
should certainly have concluded that, where the General was his
enemy, Charlie Pendragon could be no other than a friend.&nbsp;
But such was the fever and perturbation of his mind that he was
struck by none of these considerations, and only continued to run
the faster up the lane.</p>
<p>Charlie, by the sound of his voice and the vile terms that he
hurled after the secretary, was obviously beside himself with
rage.&nbsp; He, too, ran his very best; but, try as he might, the
physical advantages were not upon his side, and his outcries and
the fall of his lame foot on the macadam began to fall farther
and farther into the wake.</p>
<p>Harry&rsquo;s hopes began once more to arise.&nbsp; The lane
was both steep and narrow, but it was exceedingly solitary,
bordered on either hand by garden walls, overhung with foliage;
and, for as far as the fugitive could see in front of him, there
was neither a creature moving nor an open door.&nbsp; Providence,
weary of persecution, was now offering him an open field for his
escape.</p>
<p>Alas! as he came abreast of a garden door under a tuft of
chestnuts, it was suddenly drawn back, and he could see inside,
upon a garden path, the figure of a butcher&rsquo;s boy with his
tray upon his arm.&nbsp; He had hardly recognised the fact before
he was some steps beyond upon the other side.&nbsp; But the
fellow had had time to observe him; he was evidently much
surprised to see a gentleman go by at so unusual a pace; and he
came out into the lane and began to call after Harry with shouts
of ironical encouragement.</p>
<p>His appearance gave a new idea to Charlie Pendragon, who,
although he was now sadly out of breath, once more upraised his
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stop, thief!&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>And immediately the butcher&rsquo;s boy had taken up the cry
and joined in the pursuit.</p>
<p>This was a bitter moment for the hunted secretary.&nbsp; It is
true that his terror enabled him once more to improve his pace,
and gain with every step on his pursuers; but he was well aware
that he was near the end of his resources, and should he meet any
one coming the other way, his predicament in the narrow lane
would be desperate indeed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must find a place of concealment,&rdquo; he thought,
&ldquo;and that within the next few seconds, or all is over with
me in this world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Scarcely had the thought crossed his mind than the lane took a
sudden turning; and he found himself hidden from his
enemies.&nbsp; There are circumstances in which even the least
energetic of mankind learn to behave with vigour and decision;
and the most cautious forget their prudence and embrace foolhardy
resolutions.&nbsp; This was one of those occasions for Harry
Hartley; and those who knew him best would have been the most
astonished at the lad&rsquo;s audacity.&nbsp; He stopped dead,
flung the bandbox over a garden wall, and leaping upward with
incredible agility and seizing the copestone with his hands, he
tumbled headlong after it into the garden.</p>
<p>He came to himself a moment afterwards, seated in a border of
small rosebushes.&nbsp; His hands and knees were cut and
bleeding, for the wall had been protected against such an
escalade by a liberal provision of old bottles; and he was
conscious of a general dislocation and a painful swimming in the
head.&nbsp; Facing him across the garden, which was in admirable
order, and set with flowers of the most delicious perfume, he
beheld the back of a house.&nbsp; It was of considerable extent,
and plainly habitable; but, in odd contrast to the grounds, it
was crazy, ill-kept, and of a mean appearance.&nbsp; On all other
sides the circuit of the garden wall appeared unbroken.</p>
<p>He took in these features of the scene with mechanical
glances, but his mind was still unable to piece together or draw
a rational conclusion from what he saw. And when he heard
footsteps advancing on the gravel, although he turned his eyes in
that direction, it was with no thought either for defence or
flight.</p>
<p>The new-comer was a large, coarse, and very sordid personage,
in gardening clothes, and with a watering-pot in his left
hand.&nbsp; One less confused would have been affected with some
alarm at the sight of this man&rsquo;s huge proportions and black
and lowering eyes.&nbsp; But Harry was too gravely shaken by his
fall to be so much as terrified; and if he was unable to divert
his glances from the gardener, he remained absolutely passive,
and suffered him to draw near, to take him by the shoulder, and
to plant him roughly on his feet, without a motion of
resistance.</p>
<p>For a moment the two stared into each other&rsquo;s eyes,
Harry fascinated, the man filled with wrath and a cruel, sneering
humour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Who are you to come flying over my wall and break my
<i>Gloire de Dijons</i>!&nbsp; What is your name?&rdquo; he
added, shaking him; &ldquo;and what may be your business
here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry could not as much as proffer a word in explanation.</p>
<p>But just at that moment Pendragon and the butcher&rsquo;s boy
went clumping past, and the sound of their feet and their hoarse
cries echoed loudly in the narrow lane.&nbsp; The gardener had
received his answer; and he looked down into Harry&rsquo;s face
with an obnoxious smile.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Upon my word, and
a very good thing you must make of it; for I see you dressed like
a gentleman from top to toe.&nbsp; Are you not ashamed to go
about the world in such a trim, with honest folk, I dare say,
glad to buy your cast-off finery second hand?&nbsp; Speak up, you
dog,&rdquo; the man went on; &ldquo;you can understand English, I
suppose; and I mean to have a bit of talk with you before I march
you to the station.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, sir,&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;this is all a
dreadful misconception; and if you will go with me to Sir Thomas
Vandeleur&rsquo;s in Eaton Place, I can promise that all will be
made plain.&nbsp; The most upright person, as I now perceive, can
be led into suspicious positions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My little man,&rdquo; replied the gardener, &ldquo;I
will go with you no farther than the station-house in the next
street.&nbsp; The inspector, no doubt, will be glad to take a
stroll with you as far as Eaton Place, and have a bit of
afternoon tea with your great acquaintances.&nbsp; Or would you
prefer to go direct to the Home Secretary?&nbsp; Sir Thomas
Vandeleur, indeed!&nbsp; Perhaps you think I don&rsquo;t know a
gentleman when I see one, from a common run-the-hedge like
you?&nbsp; Clothes or no clothes, I can read you like a
book.&nbsp; Here is a shirt that maybe cost as much as my Sunday
hat; and that coat, I take it, has never seen the inside of
Rag-fair, and then your boots&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man, whose eyes had fallen upon the ground, stopped short
in his insulting commentary, and remained for a moment looking
intently upon something at his feet.&nbsp; When he spoke his
voice was strangely altered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What, in God&rsquo;s name,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is
all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry, following the direction of the man&rsquo;s eyes, beheld
a spectacle that struck him dumb with terror and amazement.&nbsp;
In his fall he had descended vertically upon the bandbox and
burst it open from end to end; thence a great treasure of
diamonds had poured forth, and now lay abroad, part trodden in
the soil, part scattered on the surface in regal and glittering
profusion.&nbsp; There was a magnificent coronet which he had
often admired on Lady Vandeleur; there were rings and brooches,
ear-drops and bracelets, and even unset brilliants rolling here
and there among the rosebushes like drops of morning dew.&nbsp; A
princely fortune lay between the two men upon the ground&mdash;a
fortune in the most inviting, solid, and durable form, capable of
being carried in an apron, beautiful in itself, and scattering
the sunlight in a million rainbow flashes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good God!&rdquo; said Harry, &ldquo;I am
lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His mind raced backwards into the past with the incalculable
velocity of thought, and he began to comprehend his day&rsquo;s
adventures, to conceive them as a whole, and to recognise the sad
imbroglio in which his own character and fortunes had become
involved.&nbsp; He looked round him as if for help, but he was
alone in the garden, with his scattered diamonds and his
redoubtable interlocutor; and when he gave ear, there was no
sound but the rustle of the leaves and the hurried pulsation of
his heart.&nbsp; It was little wonder if the young man felt
himself deserted by his spirits, and with a broken voice repeated
his last ejaculation&mdash;&ldquo;I am lost!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The gardener peered in all directions with an air of guilt;
but there was no face at any of the windows, and he seemed to
breathe again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pick up a heart,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you fool!&nbsp;
The worst of it is done.&nbsp; Why could you not say at first
there was enough for two?&nbsp; Two?&rdquo; he repeated,
&ldquo;aye, and for two hundred!&nbsp; But come away from here,
where we may be observed; and, for the love of wisdom, straighten
out your hat and brush your clothes.&nbsp; You could not travel
two steps the figure of fun you look just now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Harry mechanically adopted these suggestions, the
gardener, getting upon his knees, hastily drew together the
scattered jewels and returned them to the bandbox.&nbsp; The
touch of these costly crystals sent a shiver of emotion through
the man&rsquo;s stalwart frame; his face was transfigured, and
his eyes shone with concupiscence; indeed it seemed as if he
luxuriously prolonged his occupation, and dallied with every
diamond that he handled.&nbsp; At last, however, it was done;
and, concealing the bandbox in his smock, the gardener beckoned
to Harry and preceded him in the direction of the house.</p>
<p>Near the door they were met by a young man evidently in holy
orders, dark and strikingly handsome, with a look of mingled
weakness and resolution, and very neatly attired after the manner
of his caste.&nbsp; The gardener was plainly annoyed by this
encounter; but he put as good a face upon it as he could, and
accosted the clergyman with an obsequious and smiling air.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here is a fine afternoon, Mr. Rolles,&rdquo; said he:
&ldquo;a fine afternoon, as sure as God made it!&nbsp; And here
is a young friend of mine who had a fancy to look at my
roses.&nbsp; I took the liberty to bring him in, for I thought
none of the lodgers would object.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking for myself,&rdquo; replied the Reverend Mr.
Rolles, &ldquo;I do not; nor do I fancy any of the rest of us
would be more difficult upon so small a matter.&nbsp; The garden
is your own, Mr. Raeburn; we must none of us forget that; and
because you give us liberty to walk there we should be indeed
ungracious if we so far presumed upon your politeness as to
interfere with the convenience of your friends.&nbsp; But, on
second thoughts,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I believe that this
gentleman and I have met before.&nbsp; Mr. Hartley, I
think.&nbsp; I regret to observe that you have had a
fall.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he offered his hand.</p>
<p>A sort of maiden dignity and a desire to delay as long as
possible the necessity for explanation moved Harry to refuse this
chance of help, and to deny his own identity.&nbsp; He chose the
tender mercies of the gardener, who was at least unknown to him,
rather than the curiosity and perhaps the doubts of an
acquaintance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear there is some mistake,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My name is Thomlinson and I am a friend of Mr.
Raeburn&rsquo;s.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; said Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
likeness is amazing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Raeburn, who had been upon thorns throughout this
colloquy, now felt it high time to bring it to a period.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish you a pleasant saunter, sir,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>And with that he dragged Harry after him into the house, and
then into a chamber on the garden.&nbsp; His first care was to
draw down the blind, for Mr. Rolles still remained where they had
left him, in an attitude of perplexity and thought.&nbsp; Then he
emptied the broken bandbox on the table, and stood before the
treasure, thus fully displayed, with an expression of rapturous
greed, and rubbing his hands upon his thighs.&nbsp; For Harry,
the sight of the man&rsquo;s face under the influence of this
base emotion, added another pang to those he was already
suffering.&nbsp; It seemed incredible that, from his life of pure
and delicate trifling, he should be plunged in a breath among
sordid and criminal relations.&nbsp; He could reproach his
conscience with no sinful act; and yet he was now suffering the
punishment of sin in its most acute and cruel forms&mdash;the
dread of punishment, the suspicions of the good, and the
companionship and contamination of vile and brutal natures.&nbsp;
He felt he could lay his life down with gladness to escape from
the room and the society of Mr. Raeburn.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said the latter, after he had separated
the jewels into two nearly equal parts, and drawn one of them
nearer to himself; &ldquo;and now,&rdquo; said he,
&ldquo;everything in this world has to be paid for, and some
things sweetly.&nbsp; You must know, Mr. Hartley, if such be your
name, that I am a man of a very easy temper, and good nature has
been my stumbling-block from first to last.&nbsp; I could pocket
the whole of these pretty pebbles, if I chose, and I should like
to see you dare to say a word; but I think I must have taken a
liking to you; for I declare I have not the heart to shave you so
close.&nbsp; So, do you see, in pure kind feeling, I propose that
we divide; and these,&rdquo; indicating the two heaps, &ldquo;are
the proportions that seem to me just and friendly.&nbsp; Do you
see any objection, Mr. Hartley, may I ask?&nbsp; I am not the man
to stick upon a brooch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But, sir,&rdquo; cried Harry, &ldquo;what you propose
to me is impossible.&nbsp; The jewels are not mine, and I cannot
share what is another&rsquo;s, no matter with whom, nor in what
proportions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are not yours, are they not?&rdquo; returned
Raeburn.&nbsp; &ldquo;And you could not share them with anybody,
couldn&rsquo;t you?&nbsp; Well now, that is what I call a pity;
for here am I obliged to take you to the station.&nbsp; The
police&mdash;think of that,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;think of
the disgrace for your respectable parents; think,&rdquo; he went
on, taking Harry by the wrist; &ldquo;think of the Colonies and
the Day of Judgment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot help it,&rdquo; wailed Harry.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not my fault.&nbsp; You will not come with me to Eaton
Place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the man, &ldquo;I will not, that is
certain.&nbsp; And I mean to divide these playthings with you
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying he applied a sudden and severe torsion to the
lad&rsquo;s wrist.</p>
<p>Harry could not suppress a scream, and the perspiration burst
forth upon his face.&nbsp; Perhaps pain and terror quickened his
intelligence, but certainly at that moment the whole business
flashed across him in another light; and he saw that there was
nothing for it but to accede to the ruffian&rsquo;s proposal, and
trust to find the house and force him to disgorge, under more
favourable circumstances, and when he himself was clear from all
suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is a lamb,&rdquo; sneered the gardener.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I thought you would recognise your interests at
last.&nbsp; This bandbox,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I shall
burn with my rubbish; it is a thing that curious folk might
recognise; and as for you, scrape up your gaieties and put them
in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry proceeded to obey, Raeburn watching him, and every now
and again his greed rekindled by some bright scintillation,
abstracting another jewel from the secretary&rsquo;s share, and
adding it to his own.</p>
<p>When this was finished, both proceeded to the front door,
which Raeburn cautiously opened to observe the street.&nbsp; This
was apparently clear of passengers; for he suddenly seized Harry
by the nape of the neck, and holding his face downward so that he
could see nothing but the roadway and the doorsteps of the
houses, pushed him violently before him down one street and up
another for the space of perhaps a minute and a half.&nbsp; Harry
had counted three corners before the bully relaxed his grasp, and
crying, &ldquo;Now be off with you!&rdquo; sent the lad flying
head foremost with a well-directed and athletic kick.</p>
<p>When Harry gathered himself up, half-stunned and bleeding
freely at the nose, Mr. Raeburn had entirely disappeared.&nbsp;
For the first time, anger and pain so completely overcame the
lad&rsquo;s spirits that he burst into a fit of tears and
remained sobbing in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>After he had thus somewhat assuaged his emotion, he began to
look about him and read the names of the streets at whose
intersection he had been deserted by the gardener.&nbsp; He was
still in an unfrequented portion of West London, among villas and
large gardens; but he could see some persons at a window who had
evidently witnessed his misfortune; and almost immediately after
a servant came running from the house and offered him a glass of
water.&nbsp; At the same time, a dirty rogue, who had been
slouching somewhere in the neighbourhood, drew near him from the
other side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Poor fellow,&rdquo; said the maid, &ldquo;how vilely
you have been handled, to be sure!&nbsp; Why, your knees are all
cut, and your clothes ruined!&nbsp; Do you know the wretch who
used you so?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That I do!&rdquo; cried Harry, who was somewhat
refreshed by the water; &ldquo;and shall run him home in spite of
his precautions.&nbsp; He shall pay dearly for this day&rsquo;s
work, I promise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You had better come into the house and have yourself
washed and brushed,&rdquo; continued the maid.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
mistress will make you welcome, never fear.&nbsp; And see, I will
pick up your hat.&nbsp; Why, love of mercy!&rdquo; she screamed,
&ldquo;if you have not dropped diamonds all over the
street!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Such was the case; a good half of what remained to him after
the depredations of Mr. Raeburn, had been shaken out of his
pockets by the summersault and once more lay glittering on the
ground.&nbsp; He blessed his fortune that the maid had been so
quick of eye; &ldquo;there is nothing so bad but it might be
worse,&rdquo; thought he; and the recovery of these few seemed to
him almost as great an affair as the loss of all the rest.&nbsp;
But, alas! as he stooped to pick up his treasures, the loiterer
made a rapid onslaught, overset both Harry and the maid with a
movement of his arms, swept up a double handful of the diamonds,
and made off along the street with an amazing swiftness.</p>
<p>Harry, as soon as he could get upon his feet, gave chase to
the miscreant with many cries, but the latter was too fleet of
foot, and probably too well acquainted with the locality; for
turn where the pursuer would he could find no traces of the
fugitive.</p>
<p>In the deepest despondency, Harry revisited the scene of his
mishap, where the maid, who was still waiting, very honestly
returned him his hat and the remainder of the fallen
diamonds.&nbsp; Harry thanked her from his heart, and being now
in no humour for economy, made his way to the nearest cab-stand
and set off for Eaton Place by coach.</p>
<p>The house, on his arrival, seemed in some confusion, as if a
catastrophe had happened in the family; and the servants
clustered together in the hall, and were unable, or perhaps not
altogether anxious, to suppress their merriment at the
tatterdemalion figure of the secretary.&nbsp; He passed them with
as good an air of dignity as he could assume, and made directly
for the boudoir.&nbsp; When he opened the door an astonishing and
even menacing spectacle presented itself to his eyes; for he
beheld the General and his wife and, of all people, Charlie
Pendragon, closeted together and speaking with earnestness and
gravity on some important subject.&nbsp; Harry saw at once that
there was little left for him to explain&mdash;plenary confession
had plainly been made to the General of the intended fraud upon
his pocket, and the unfortunate miscarriage of the scheme; and
they had all made common cause against a common danger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank Heaven!&rdquo; cried Lady Vandeleur, &ldquo;here
he is!&nbsp; The bandbox, Harry&mdash;the bandbox!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Harry stood before them silent and downcast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speak!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak!&nbsp;
Where is the bandbox?&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the men, with threatening gestures, repeated the
demand.</p>
<p>Harry drew a handful of jewels from his pocket.&nbsp; He was
very white.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is all that remains,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I declare before Heaven it was through no fault of mine;
and if you will have patience, although some are lost, I am
afraid, for ever, others, I am sure, may be still
recovered.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; cried Lady Vandeleur, &ldquo;all our
diamonds are gone, and I owe ninety thousand pounds for
dress!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said the General, &ldquo;you might have
paved the gutter with your own trash; you might have made debts
to fifty times the sum you mention; you might have robbed me of
my mother&rsquo;s coronet and ring; and Nature might have still
so far prevailed that I could have forgiven you at last.&nbsp;
But, madam, you have taken the Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond&mdash;the
Eye of Light, as the Orientals poetically termed it&mdash;the
Pride of Kashgar!&nbsp; You have taken from me the Rajah&rsquo;s
Diamond,&rdquo; he cried, raising his hands, &ldquo;and all,
madam, all is at an end between us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Believe me, General Vandeleur,&rdquo; she replied,
&ldquo;that is one of the most agreeable speeches that ever I
heard from your lips; and since we are to be ruined, I could
almost welcome the change, if it delivers me from you.&nbsp; You
have told me often enough that I married you for your money; let
me tell you now that I always bitterly repented the bargain; and
if you were still marriageable, and had a diamond bigger than
your head, I should counsel even my maid against a union so
uninviting and disastrous.&nbsp; As for you, Mr. Hartley,&rdquo;
she continued, turning on the secretary, &ldquo;you have
sufficiently exhibited your valuable qualities in this house; we
are now persuaded that you equally lack manhood, sense, and
self-respect; and I can see only one course open for you&mdash;to
withdraw instanter, and, if possible, return no more.&nbsp; For
your wages you may rank as a creditor in my late husband&rsquo;s
bankruptcy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Harry had scarcely comprehended this insulting address before
the General was down upon him with another.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime,&rdquo; said that personage,
&ldquo;follow me before the nearest Inspector of Police.&nbsp;
You may impose upon a simple-minded soldier, sir, but the eye of
the law will read your disreputable secret.&nbsp; If I must spend
my old age in poverty through your underhand intriguing with my
wife, I mean at least that you shall not remain unpunished for
your pains; and God, sir, will deny me a very considerable
satisfaction if you do not pick oakum from now until your dying
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that, the General dragged Harry from the apartment, and
hurried him downstairs and along the street to the police-station
of the district.</p>

116</span>STORY OF THE YOUNG MAN IN HOLY ORDERS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> Reverend Mr. Simon Rolles had
distinguished himself in the Moral Sciences, and was more than
usually proficient in the study of Divinity.&nbsp; His essay
&ldquo;On the Christian Doctrine of the Social Obligations&rdquo;
obtained for him, at the moment of its production, a certain
celebrity in the University of Oxford; and it was understood in
clerical and learned circles that young Mr. Rolles had in
contemplation a considerable work&mdash;a folio, it was
said&mdash;on the authority of the Fathers of the Church.&nbsp;
These attainments, these ambitious designs, however, were far
from helping him to any preferment; and he was still in quest of
his first curacy when a chance ramble in that part of London, the
peaceful and rich aspect of the garden, a desire for solitude and
study, and the cheapness of the lodging, led him to take up his
abode with Mr. Raeburn, the nurseryman of Stockdove Lane.</p>
<p>It was his habit every afternoon, after he had worked seven or
eight hours on St. Ambrose or St. Chrysostom, to walk for a while
in meditation among the roses.&nbsp; And this was usually one of
the most productive moments of his day.&nbsp; But even a sincere
appetite for thought, and the excitement of grave problems
awaiting solution, are not always sufficient to preserve the mind
of the philosopher against the petty shocks and contacts of the
world.&nbsp; And when Mr. Rolles found General Vandeleur&rsquo;s
secretary, ragged and bleeding, in the company of his landlord;
when he saw both change colour and seek to avoid his questions;
and, above all, when the former denied his own identity with the
most unmoved assurance, he speedily forgot the Saints and Fathers
in the vulgar interest of curiosity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot be mistaken,&rdquo; thought he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;That is Mr. Hartley beyond a doubt.&nbsp; How comes he in
such a pickle? why does he deny his name? and what can be his
business with that black-looking ruffian, my landlord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he was thus reflecting, another peculiar circumstance
attracted his attention.&nbsp; The face of Mr. Raeburn appeared
at a low window next the door; and, as chance directed, his eyes
met those of Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; The nurseryman seemed
disconcerted, and even alarmed; and immediately after the blind
of the apartment was pulled sharply down.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This may all be very well,&rdquo; reflected Mr. Rolles;
&ldquo;it may be all excellently well; but I confess freely that
I do not think so.&nbsp; Suspicious, underhand, untruthful,
fearful of observation&mdash;I believe upon my soul,&rdquo; he
thought, &ldquo;the pair are plotting some disgraceful
action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The detective that there is in all of us awoke and became
clamant in the bosom of Mr. Rolles; and with a brisk, eager step,
that bore no resemblance to his usual gait, he proceeded to make
the circuit of the garden.&nbsp; When he came to the scene of
Harry&rsquo;s escalade, his eye was at once arrested by a broken
rosebush and marks of trampling on the mould.&nbsp; He looked up,
and saw scratches on the brick, and a rag of trouser floating
from a broken bottle.&nbsp; This, then, was the mode of entrance
chosen by Mr. Raeburn&rsquo;s particular friend!&nbsp; It was
thus that General Vandeleur&rsquo;s secretary came to admire a
flower-garden!&nbsp; The young clergyman whistled softly to
himself as he stooped to examine the ground.&nbsp; He could make
out where Harry had landed from his perilous leap; he recognised
the flat foot of Mr. Raeburn where it had sunk deeply in the soil
as he pulled up the Secretary by the collar; nay, on a closer
inspection, he seemed to distinguish the marks of groping
fingers, as though something had been spilt abroad and eagerly
collected.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;the thing grows
vastly interesting.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then he caught sight of something almost entirely
buried in the earth.&nbsp; In an instant he had disinterred a
dainty morocco case, ornamented and clasped in gilt.&nbsp; It had
been trodden heavily underfoot, and thus escaped the hurried
search of Mr. Raeburn.&nbsp; Mr. Rolles opened the case, and drew
a long breath of almost horrified astonishment; for there lay
before him, in a cradle of green velvet, a diamond of prodigious
magnitude and of the finest water.&nbsp; It was of the bigness of
a duck&rsquo;s egg; beautifully shaped, and without a flaw; and
as the sun shone upon it, it gave forth a lustre like that of
electricity, and seemed to burn in his hand with a thousand
internal fires.</p>
<p>He knew little of precious stones; but the Rajah&rsquo;s
Diamond was a wonder that explained itself; a village child, if
he found it, would run screaming for the nearest cottage; and a
savage would prostrate himself in adoration before so imposing a
fetish.&nbsp; The beauty of the stone flattered the young
clergyman&rsquo;s eyes; the thought of its incalculable value
overpowered his intellect.&nbsp; He knew that what he held in his
hand was worth more than many years&rsquo; purchase of an
archiepiscopal see; that it would build cathedrals more stately
than Ely or Cologne; that he who possessed it was set free for
ever from the primal curse, and might follow his own inclinations
without concern or hurry, without let or hindrance.&nbsp; And as
he suddenly turned it, the rays leaped forth again with renewed
brilliancy, and seemed to pierce his very heart.</p>
<p>Decisive actions are often taken in a moment and without any
conscious deliverance from the rational parts of man.&nbsp; So it
was now with Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; He glanced hurriedly round;
beheld, like Mr. Raeburn before him, nothing but the sunlit
flower-garden, the tall tree-tops, and the house with blinded
windows; and in a trice he had shut the case, thrust it into his
pocket, and was hastening to his study with the speed of
guilt.</p>
<p>The Reverend Simon Rolles had stolen the Rajah&rsquo;s
Diamond.</p>
<p>Early in the afternoon the police arrived with Harry
Hartley.&nbsp; The nurseryman, who was beside himself with
terror, readily discovered his hoard; and the jewels were
identified and inventoried in the presence of the
Secretary.&nbsp; As for Mr. Rolles, he showed himself in a most
obliging temper, communicated what he knew with freedom, and
professed regret that he could do no more to help the officers in
their duty.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Still,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I suppose your business
is nearly at an end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By no means,&rdquo; replied the man from Scotland Yard;
and he narrated the second robbery of which Harry had been the
immediate victim, and gave the young clergyman a description of
the more important jewels that were still not found, dilating
particularly on the Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It must be worth a fortune,&rdquo; observed Mr.
Rolles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ten fortunes&mdash;twenty fortunes,&rdquo; cried the
officer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The more it is worth,&rdquo; remarked Simon shrewdly,
&ldquo;the more difficult it must be to sell.&nbsp; Such a thing
has a physiognomy not to be disguised, and I should fancy a man
might as easily negotiate St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, truly!&rdquo; said the officer; &ldquo;but if the
thief be a man of any intelligence, he will cut it into three or
four, and there will be still enough to make him rich.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said the clergyman.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
cannot imagine how much your conversation interests
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whereupon the functionary admitted that they knew many strange
things in his profession, and immediately after took his
leave.</p>
<p>Mr. Rolles regained his apartment.&nbsp; It seemed smaller and
barer than usual; the materials for his great work had never
presented so little interest; and he looked upon his library with
the eye of scorn.&nbsp; He took down, volume by volume, several
Fathers of the Church, and glanced them through; but they
contained nothing to his purpose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;These old gentlemen,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;are no
doubt very valuable writers, but they seem to me conspicuously
ignorant of life.&nbsp; Here am I, with learning enough to be a
Bishop, and I positively do not know how to dispose of a stolen
diamond.&nbsp; I glean a hint from a common policeman, and, with
all my folios, I cannot so much as put it into execution.&nbsp;
This inspires me with very low ideas of University
training.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Herewith he kicked over his book-shelf and, putting on his
hat, hastened from the house to the club of which he was a
member.&nbsp; In such a place of mundane resort he hoped to find
some man of good counsel and a shrewd experience in life.&nbsp;
In the reading-room he saw many of the country clergy and an
Archdeacon; there were three journalists and a writer upon the
Higher Metaphysic, playing pool; and at dinner only the raff of
ordinary club frequenters showed their commonplace and
obliterated countenances.&nbsp; None of these, thought Mr.
Rolles, would know more on dangerous topics than he knew himself;
none of them were fit to give him guidance in his present
strait.&nbsp; At length in the smoking-room, up many weary
stairs, he hit upon a gentleman of somewhat portly build and
dressed with conspicuous plainness.&nbsp; He was smoking a cigar
and reading the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>; his face was
singularly free from all sign of preoccupation or fatigue; and
there was something in his air which seemed to invite confidence
and to expect submission.&nbsp; The more the young clergyman
scrutinised his features, the more he was convinced that he had
fallen on one capable of giving pertinent advice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you will excuse my
abruptness; but I judge you from your appearance to be
pre-eminently a man of the world.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have indeed considerable claims to that
distinction,&rdquo; replied the stranger, laying aside his
magazine with a look of mingled amusement and surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I, sir,&rdquo; continued the Curate, &ldquo;am a
recluse, a student, a creature of ink-bottles and patristic
folios.&nbsp; A recent event has brought my folly vividly before
my eyes, and I desire to instruct myself in life.&nbsp; By
life,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;I do not mean Thackeray&rsquo;s
novels; but the crimes and secret possibilities of our society,
and the principles of wise conduct among exceptional
events.&nbsp; I am a patient reader; can the thing be learnt in
books?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You put me in a difficulty,&rdquo; said the
stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I confess I have no great notion of the
use of books, except to amuse a railway journey; although, I
believe, there are some very exact treatises on astronomy, the
use of the globes, agriculture, and the art of making paper
flowers.&nbsp; Upon the less apparent provinces of life I fear
you will find nothing truthful.&nbsp; Yet stay,&rdquo; he added,
&ldquo;have you read Gaboriau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Rolles admitted he had never even heard the name.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may gather some notions from Gaboriau,&rdquo;
resumed the stranger.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is at least suggestive; and
as he is an author much studied by Prince Bismarck, you will, at
the worst, lose your time in good society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the Curate, &ldquo;I am infinitely
obliged by your politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have already more than repaid me,&rdquo; returned
the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How?&rdquo; inquired Simon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By the novelty of your request,&rdquo; replied the
gentleman; and with a polite gesture, as though to ask
permission, he resumed the study of the <i>Fortnightly
Review</i>.</p>
<p>On his way home Mr. Rolles purchased a work on precious stones
and several of Gaboriau&rsquo;s novels.&nbsp; These last he
eagerly skimmed until an advanced hour in the morning; but
although they introduced him to many new ideas, he could nowhere
discover what to do with a stolen diamond.&nbsp; He was annoyed,
moreover, to find the information scattered amongst romantic
story-telling, instead of soberly set forth after the manner of a
manual; and he concluded that, even if the writer had thought
much upon these subjects, he was totally lacking in educational
method.&nbsp; For the character and attainments of Lecoq,
however, he was unable to contain his admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He was truly a great creature,&rdquo; ruminated Mr.
Rolles.&nbsp; &ldquo;He knew the world as I know Paley&rsquo;s
Evidences.&nbsp; There was nothing that he could not carry to a
termination with his own hand, and against the largest
odds.&nbsp; Heavens!&rdquo; he broke out suddenly, &ldquo;is not
this the lesson?&nbsp; Must I not learn to cut diamonds for
myself?&rdquo;</p>
<p>It seemed to him as if he had sailed at once out of his
perplexities; he remembered that he knew a jeweller, one B.
Macculloch, in Edinburgh, who would be glad to put him in the way
of the necessary training; a few months, perhaps a few years, of
sordid toil, and he would be sufficiently expert to divide and
sufficiently cunning to dispose with advantage of the
Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond.&nbsp; That done, he might return to pursue
his researches at leisure, a wealthy and luxurious student,
envied and respected by all.&nbsp; Golden visions attended him
through his slumber, and he awoke refreshed and light-hearted
with the morning sun.</p>
<p>Mr. Raeburn&rsquo;s house was on that day to be closed by the
police, and this afforded a pretext for his departure.&nbsp; He
cheerfully prepared his baggage, transported it to King&rsquo;s
Cross, where he left it in the cloak-room, and returned to the
club to while away the afternoon and dine.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you dine here to-day, Rolles,&rdquo; observed an
acquaintance, &ldquo;you may see two of the most remarkable men
in England&mdash;Prince Florizel of Bohemia, and old Jack
Vandeleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard of the Prince,&rdquo; replied Mr. Rolles;
&ldquo;and General Vandeleur I have even met in
society.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;General Vandeleur is an ass!&rdquo; returned the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is his brother John, the biggest
adventurer, the best judge of precious stones, and one of the
most acute diplomatists in Europe.&nbsp; Have you never heard of
his duel with the Duc de Val d&rsquo;Orge? of his exploits and
atrocities when he was Dictator of Paraguay? of his dexterity in
recovering Sir Samuel Levi&rsquo;s jewellery? nor of his services
in the Indian Mutiny&mdash;services by which the Government
profited, but which the Government dared not recognise?&nbsp; You
make me wonder what we mean by fame, or even by infamy; for Jack
Vandeleur has prodigious claims to both.&nbsp; Run
downstairs,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;take a table near them,
and keep your ears open.&nbsp; You will hear some strange talk,
or I am much misled.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But how shall I know them?&rdquo; inquired the
clergyman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know them!&rdquo; cried his friend; &ldquo;why, the
Prince is the finest gentleman in Europe, the only living
creature who looks like a king; and as for Jack Vandeleur, if you
can imagine Ulysses at seventy years of age, and with a sabre-cut
across his face, you have the man before you!&nbsp; Know them,
indeed!&nbsp; Why, you could pick either of them out of a Derby
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rolles eagerly hurried to the dining-room.&nbsp; It was as his
friend had asserted; it was impossible to mistake the pair in
question.&nbsp; Old John Vandeleur was of a remarkable force of
body, and obviously broken to the most difficult exercises.&nbsp;
He had neither the carriage of a swordsman, nor of a sailor, nor
yet of one much inured to the saddle; but something made up of
all these, and the result and expression of many different habits
and dexterities.&nbsp; His features were bold and aquiline; his
expression arrogant and predatory; his whole appearance that of a
swift, violent, unscrupulous man of action; and his copious white
hair and the deep sabre-cut that traversed his nose and temple
added a note of savagery to a head already remarkable and
menacing in itself.</p>
<p>In his companion, the Prince of Bohemia, Mr. Rolles was
astonished to recognise the gentleman who had recommended him the
study of Gaboriau.&nbsp; Doubtless Prince Florizel, who rarely
visited the club, of which, as of most others, he was an honorary
member, had been waiting for John Vandeleur when Simon accosted
him on the previous evening.</p>
<p>The other diners had modestly retired into the angles of the
room, and left the distinguished pair in a certain isolation, but
the young clergyman was unrestrained by any sentiment of awe,
and, marching boldly up, took his place at the nearest table.</p>
<p>The conversation was, indeed, new to the student&rsquo;s
ears.&nbsp; The ex-Dictator of Paraguay stated many extraordinary
experiences in different quarters of the world; and the Prince
supplied a commentary which, to a man of thought, was even more
interesting than the events themselves.&nbsp; Two forms of
experience were thus brought together and laid before the young
clergyman; and he did not know which to admire the most&mdash;the
desperate actor or the skilled expert in life; the man who spoke
boldly of his own deeds and perils, or the man who seemed, like a
god, to know all things and to have suffered nothing.&nbsp; The
manner of each aptly fitted with his part in the discourse.&nbsp;
The Dictator indulged in brutalities alike of speech and gesture;
his hand opened and shut and fell roughly on the table; and his
voice was loud and heavy.&nbsp; The Prince, on the other hand,
seemed the very type of urbane docility and quiet; the least
movement, the least inflection, had with him a weightier
significance than all the shouts and pantomime of his companion;
and if ever, as must frequently have been the case, he described
some experience personal to himself, it was so aptly dissimulated
as to pass unnoticed with the rest.</p>
<p>At length the talk wandered on to the late robberies and the
Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That diamond would be better in the sea,&rdquo;
observed Prince Florizel.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As a Vandeleur,&rdquo; replied the Dictator,
&ldquo;your Highness may imagine my dissent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I speak on grounds of public policy,&rdquo; pursued the
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;Jewels so valuable should be reserved for
the collection of a Prince or the treasury of a great
nation.&nbsp; To hand them about among the common sort of men is
to set a price on Virtue&rsquo;s head; and if the Rajah of
Kashgar&mdash;a Prince, I understand, of great
enlightenment&mdash;desired vengeance upon the men of Europe, he
could hardly have gone more efficaciously about his purpose than
by sending us this apple of discord.&nbsp; There is no honesty
too robust for such a trial.&nbsp; I myself, who have many duties
and many privileges of my own&mdash;I myself, Mr. Vandeleur,
could scarce handle the intoxicating crystal and be safe.&nbsp;
As for you, who are a diamond hunter by taste and profession, I
do not believe there is a crime in the calendar you would not
perpetrate&mdash;I do not believe you have a friend in the world
whom you would not eagerly betray&mdash;I do not know if you have
a family, but if you have I declare you would sacrifice your
children&mdash;and all this for what?&nbsp; Not to be richer, nor
to have more comforts or more respect, but simply to call this
diamond yours for a year or two until you die, and now and again
to open a safe and look at it as one looks at a
picture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; replied Vandeleur.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have hunted most things, from men and women down to mosquitos; I
have dived for coral; I have followed both whales and tigers; and
a diamond is the tallest quarry of the lot.&nbsp; It has beauty
and worth; it alone can properly reward the ardours of the
chase.&nbsp; At this moment, as your Highness may fancy, I am
upon the trail; I have a sure knack, a wide experience; I know
every stone of price in my brother&rsquo;s collection as a
shepherd knows his sheep; and I wish I may die if I do not
recover them every one!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas Vandeleur will have great cause to thank
you,&rdquo; said the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure,&rdquo; returned the Dictator, with a
laugh.&nbsp; &ldquo;One of the Vandeleurs will.&nbsp; Thomas or
John&mdash;Peter or Paul&mdash;we are all apostles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not catch your observation,&rdquo; said the
Prince with some disgust.</p>
<p>And at the same moment the waiter informed Mr. Vandeleur that
his cab was at the door.</p>
<p>Mr. Rolles glanced at the clock, and saw that he also must be
moving; and the coincidence struck him sharply and unpleasantly,
for he desired to see no more of the diamond hunter.</p>
<p>Much study having somewhat shaken the young man&rsquo;s
nerves, he was in the habit of travelling in the most luxurious
manner; and for the present journey he had taken a sofa in the
sleeping carriage.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will be very comfortable,&rdquo; said the guard;
&ldquo;there is no one in your compartment, and only one old
gentleman in the other end.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was close upon the hour, and the tickets were being
examined, when Mr. Rolles beheld this other fellow-passenger
ushered by several porters into his place; certainly, there was
not another man in the world whom he would not have
preferred&mdash;for it was old John Vandeleur, the
ex-Dictator.</p>
<p>The sleeping carriages on the Great Northern line were divided
into three compartments&mdash;one at each end for travellers, and
one in the centre fitted with the conveniences of a
lavatory.&nbsp; A door running in grooves separated each of the
others from the lavatory; but as there were neither bolts nor
locks, the whole suite was practically common ground.</p>
<p>When Mr. Rolles had studied his position, he perceived himself
without defence.&nbsp; If the Dictator chose to pay him a visit
in the course of the night, he could do no less than receive it;
he had no means of fortification, and lay open to attack as if he
had been lying in the fields.&nbsp; This situation caused him
some agony of mind.&nbsp; He recalled with alarm the boastful
statements of his fellow-traveller across the dining-table, and
the professions of immorality which he had heard him offering to
the disgusted Prince.&nbsp; Some persons, he remembered to have
read, are endowed with a singular quickness of perception for the
neighbourhood of precious metals; through walls and even at
considerable distances they are said to divine the presence of
gold.&nbsp; Might it not be the same with diamonds? he wondered;
and if so, who was more likely to enjoy this transcendental sense
than the person who gloried in the appellation of the Diamond
Hunter?&nbsp; From such a man he recognised that he had
everything to fear, and longed eagerly for the arrival of the
day.</p>
<p>In the meantime he neglected no precaution, concealed his
diamond in the most internal pocket of a system of great-coats,
and devoutly recommended himself to the care of Providence.</p>
<p>The train pursued its usual even and rapid course; and nearly
half the journey had been accomplished before slumber began to
triumph over uneasiness in the breast of Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; For
some time he resisted its influence; but it grew upon him more
and more, and a little before York he was fain to stretch himself
upon one of the couches and suffer his eyes to close; and almost
at the same instant consciousness deserted the young
clergyman.&nbsp; His last thought was of his terrifying
neighbour.</p>
<p>When he awoke it was still pitch dark, except for the flicker
of the veiled lamp; and the continual roaring and oscillation
testified to the unrelaxed velocity of the train.&nbsp; He sat
upright in a panic, for he had been tormented by the most uneasy
dreams; it was some seconds before he recovered his self-command;
and even after he had resumed a recumbent attitude sleep
continued to flee him, and he lay awake with his brain in a state
of violent agitation, and his eyes fixed upon the lavatory
door.&nbsp; He pulled his clerical felt hat over his brow still
farther to shield him from the light; and he adopted the usual
expedients, such as counting a thousand or banishing thought, by
which experienced invalids are accustomed to woo the approach of
sleep.&nbsp; In the case of Mr. Rolles they proved one and all
vain; he was harassed by a dozen different anxieties&mdash;the
old man in the other end of the carriage haunted him in the most
alarming shapes; and in whatever attitude he chose to lie the
diamond in his pocket occasioned him a sensible physical
distress.&nbsp; It burned, it was too large, it bruised his ribs;
and there were infinitesimal fractions of a second in which he
had half a mind to throw it from the window.</p>
<p>While he was thus lying, a strange incident took place.</p>
<p>The sliding-door into the lavatory stirred a little, and then
a little more, and was finally drawn back for the space of about
twenty inches.&nbsp; The lamp in the lavatory was unshaded, and
in the lighted aperture thus disclosed, Mr. Rolles could see the
head of Mr. Vandeleur in an attitude of deep attention.&nbsp; He
was conscious that the gaze of the Dictator rested intently on
his own face; and the instinct of self-preservation moved him to
hold his breath, to refrain from the least movement, and keeping
his eyes lowered, to watch his visitor from underneath the
lashes.&nbsp; After about a moment, the head was withdrawn and
the door of the lavatory replaced.</p>
<p>The Dictator had not come to attack, but to observe; his
action was not that of a man threatening another, but that of a
man who was himself threatened; if Mr. Rolles was afraid of him,
it appeared that he, in his turn, was not quite easy on the score
of Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; He had come, it would seem, to make sure
that his only fellow-traveller was asleep; and, when satisfied on
that point, he had at once withdrawn.</p>
<p>The clergyman leaped to his feet.&nbsp; The extreme of terror
had given place to a reaction of foolhardy daring.&nbsp; He
reflected that the rattle of the flying train concealed all other
sounds, and determined, come what might, to return the visit he
had just received.&nbsp; Divesting himself of his cloak, which
might have interfered with the freedom of his action, he entered
the lavatory and paused to listen.&nbsp; As he had expected,
there was nothing to be heard above the roar of the train&rsquo;s
progress; and laying his hand on the door at the farther side, he
proceeded cautiously to draw it back for about six inches.&nbsp;
Then he stopped, and could not contain an ejaculation of
surprise.</p>
<p>John Vandeleur wore a fur travelling cap with lappets to
protect his ears; and this may have combined with the sound of
the express to keep him in ignorance of what was going
forward.&nbsp; It is certain, at least, that he did not raise his
head, but continued without interruption to pursue his strange
employment.&nbsp; Between his feet stood an open hat-box; in one
hand he held the sleeve of his sealskin great-coat; in the other
a formidable knife, with which he had just slit up the lining of
the sleeve.&nbsp; Mr. Rolles had read of persons carrying money
in a belt; and as he had no acquaintance with any but
cricket-belts, he had never been able rightly to conceive how
this was managed.&nbsp; But here was a stranger thing before his
eyes; for John Vandeleur, it appeared, carried diamonds in the
lining of his sleeve; and even as the young clergyman gazed, he
could see one glittering brilliant drop after another into the
hat-box.</p>
<p>He stood riveted to the spot, following this unusual business
with his eyes.&nbsp; The diamonds were, for the most part, small,
and not easily distinguishable either in shape or fire.&nbsp;
Suddenly the Dictator appeared to find a difficulty; he employed
both hands and stooped over his task; but it was not until after
considerable manoeuvring that he extricated a large tiara of
diamonds from the lining, and held it up for some seconds&rsquo;
examination before he placed it with the others in the
hat-box.&nbsp; The tiara was a ray of light to Mr. Rolles; he
immediately recognised it for a part of the treasure stolen from
Harry Hartley by the loiterer.&nbsp; There was no room for
mistake; it was exactly as the detective had described it; there
were the ruby stars, with a great emerald in the centre; there
were the interlacing crescents; and there were the pear-shaped
pendants, each a single stone, which gave a special value to Lady
Vandeleur&rsquo;s tiara.</p>
<p>Mr. Rolles was hugely relieved.&nbsp; The Dictator was as
deeply in the affair as he was; neither could tell tales upon the
other.&nbsp; In the first glow of happiness, the clergyman
suffered a deep sigh to escape him; and as his bosom had become
choked and his throat dry during his previous suspense, the sigh
was followed by a cough.</p>
<p>Mr. Vandeleur looked up; his face contracted with the blackest
and most deadly passion; his eyes opened widely, and his under
jaw dropped in an astonishment that was upon the brink of
fury.&nbsp; By an instinctive movement he had covered the hat-box
with the coat.&nbsp; For half a minute the two men stared upon
each other in silence.&nbsp; It was not a long interval, but it
sufficed for Mr. Rolles; he was one of those who think swiftly on
dangerous occasions; he decided on a course of action of a
singularly daring nature; and although he felt he was setting his
life upon the hazard, he was the first to break silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>The Dictator shivered slightly, and when he spoke his voice
was hoarse.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want here?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I take a particular interest in diamonds,&rdquo;
replied Mr. Rolles, with an air of perfect self-possession.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Two connoisseurs should be acquainted.&nbsp; I have here a
trifle of my own which may perhaps serve for an
introduction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying, he quietly took the case from his pocket,
showed the Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond to the Dictator for an instant,
and replaced it in security.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was once your brother&rsquo;s,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>John Vandeleur continued to regard him with a look of almost
painful amazement; but he neither spoke nor moved.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was pleased to observe,&rdquo; resumed the young man,
&ldquo;that we have gems from the same collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dictator&rsquo;s surprise overpowered him.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I begin to
perceive that I am growing old!&nbsp; I am positively not
prepared for little incidents like this.&nbsp; But set my mind at
rest upon one point: do my eyes deceive me, or are you indeed a
parson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am in holy orders,&rdquo; answered Mr. Rolles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; cried the other, &ldquo;as long as I live
I will never hear another word against the cloth!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You flatter me,&rdquo; said Mr. Rolles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; replied Vandeleur; &ldquo;pardon me,
young man.&nbsp; You are no coward, but it still remains to be
seen whether you are not the worst of fools.&nbsp;
Perhaps,&rdquo; he continued, leaning back upon his seat,
&ldquo;perhaps you would oblige me with a few particulars.&nbsp;
I must suppose you had some object in the stupefying impudence of
your proceedings, and I confess I have a curiosity to know
it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is very simple,&rdquo; replied the clergyman;
&ldquo;it proceeds from my great inexperience of life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall be glad to be persuaded,&rdquo; answered
Vandeleur.</p>
<p>Whereupon Mr. Rolles told him the whole story of his
connection with the Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond, from the time he found
it in Raeburn&rsquo;s garden to the time when he left London in
the Flying Scotchman.&nbsp; He added a brief sketch of his
feelings and thoughts during the journey, and concluded in these
words:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I recognised the tiara I knew we were in the same
attitude towards Society, and this inspired me with a hope, which
I trust you will say was not ill-founded, that you might become
in some sense my partner in the difficulties and, of course, the
profits of my situation.&nbsp; To one of your special knowledge
and obviously great experience the negotiation of the diamond
would give but little trouble, while to me it was a matter of
impossibility.&nbsp; On the other part, I judged that I might
lose nearly as much by cutting the diamond, and that not
improbably with an unskilful hand, as might enable me to pay you
with proper generosity for your assistance.&nbsp; The subject was
a delicate one to broach; and perhaps I fell short in
delicacy.&nbsp; But I must ask you to remember that for me the
situation was a new one, and I was entirely unacquainted with the
etiquette in use.&nbsp; I believe without vanity that I could
have married or baptized you in a very acceptable manner; but
every man has his own aptitudes, and this sort of bargain was not
among the list of my accomplishments.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to flatter you,&rdquo; replied Vandeleur;
&ldquo;but upon my word, you have an unusual disposition for a
life of crime.&nbsp; You have more accomplishments than you
imagine; and though I have encountered a number of rogues in
different quarters of the world, I never met with one so
unblushing as yourself.&nbsp; Cheer up, Mr. Rolles, you are in
the right profession at last!&nbsp; As for helping you, you may
command me as you will.&nbsp; I have only a day&rsquo;s business
in Edinburgh on a little matter for my brother; and once that is
concluded, I return to Paris, where I usually reside.&nbsp; If
you please, you may accompany me thither.&nbsp; And before the
end of a month I believe I shall have brought your little
business to a satisfactory conclusion.&rdquo;</p>

133</span>STORY OF THE HOUSE WITH THE GREEN BLINDS</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Francis Scrymgeour</span>, a clerk in the
Bank of Scotland at Edinburgh, had attained the age of
twenty-five in a sphere of quiet, creditable, and domestic
life.&nbsp; His mother died while he was young; but his father, a
man of sense and probity, had given him an excellent education at
school, and brought him up at home to orderly and frugal
habits.&nbsp; Francis, who was of a docile and affectionate
disposition, profited by these advantages with zeal, and devoted
himself heart and soul to his employment.&nbsp; A walk upon
Saturday afternoon, an occasional dinner with members of his
family, and a yearly tour of a fortnight in the Highlands or even
on the continent of Europe, were his principal distractions, and,
he grew rapidly in favour with his superiors, and enjoyed already
a salary of nearly two hundred pounds a year, with the prospect
of an ultimate advance to almost double that amount.&nbsp; Few
young men were more contented, few more willing and laborious
than Francis Scrymgeour.&nbsp; Sometimes at night, when he had
read the daily paper, he would play upon the flute to amuse his
father, for whose qualities he entertained a great respect.</p>
<p>One day he received a note from a well-known firm of Writers
to the Signet, requesting the favour of an immediate interview
with him.&nbsp; The letter was marked &ldquo;Private and
Confidential,&rdquo; and had been addressed to him at the bank,
instead of at home&mdash;two unusual circumstances which made him
obey the summons with the more alacrity.&nbsp; The senior member
of the firm, a man of much austerity of manner, made him gravely
welcome, requested him to take a seat, and proceeded to explain
the matter in hand in the picked expressions of a veteran man of
business.&nbsp; A person, who must remain nameless, but of whom
the lawyer had every reason to think well&mdash;a man, in short,
of some station in the country&mdash;desired to make Francis an
annual allowance of five hundred pounds.&nbsp; The capital was to
be placed under the control of the lawyer&rsquo;s firm and two
trustees who must also remain anonymous.&nbsp; There were
conditions annexed to this liberality, but he was of opinion that
his new client would find nothing either excessive or
dishonourable in the terms; and he repeated these two words with
emphasis, as though he desired to commit himself to nothing
more.</p>
<p>Francis asked their nature.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The conditions,&rdquo; said the Writer to the Signet,
&ldquo;are, as I have twice remarked, neither dishonourable nor
excessive.&nbsp; At the same time I cannot conceal from you that
they are most unusual.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole case is very much
out of our way; and I should certainly have refused it had it not
been for the reputation of the gentleman who entrusted it to my
care, and, let me add, Mr. Scrymgeour, the interest I have been
led to take in yourself by many complimentary and, I have no
doubt, well-deserved reports.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis entreated him to be more specific.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot picture my uneasiness as to these
conditions,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They are two,&rdquo; replied the lawyer, &ldquo;only
two; and the sum, as you will remember, is five hundred
a-year&mdash;and unburdened, I forgot to add,
unburdened.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the lawyer raised his eyebrows at him with solemn
gusto.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The first,&rdquo; he resumed, &ldquo;is of remarkable
simplicity.&nbsp; You must be in Paris by the afternoon of
Sunday, the 15th; there you will find, at the box-office of the
Com&eacute;die Fran&ccedil;aise, a ticket for admission taken in
your name and waiting you.&nbsp; You are requested to sit out the
whole performance in the seat provided, and that is
all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should certainly have preferred a week-day,&rdquo;
replied Francis. &ldquo; But, after all, once in a
way&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in Paris, my dear sir,&rdquo; added the lawyer
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe I am something of a precisian
myself, but upon such a consideration, and in Paris, I should not
hesitate an instant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the pair laughed pleasantly together.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The other is of more importance,&rdquo; continued the
Writer to the Signet.&nbsp; &ldquo;It regards your
marriage.&nbsp; My client, taking a deep interest in your
welfare, desires to advise you absolutely in the choice of a
wife.&nbsp; Absolutely, you understand,&rdquo; he repeated.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us be more explicit, if you please,&rdquo; returned
Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;Am I to marry any one, maid or widow, black
or white, whom this invisible person chooses to
propose?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was to assure you that suitability of age and
position should be a principle with your benefactor,&rdquo;
replied the lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;As to race, I confess the
difficulty had not occurred to me, and I failed to inquire; but
if you like I will make a note of it at once, and advise you on
the earliest opportunity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Francis, &ldquo;it remains to be seen
whether this whole affair is not a most unworthy fraud.&nbsp; The
circumstances are inexplicable&mdash;I had almost said
incredible; and until I see a little more daylight, and some
plausible motive, I confess I should be very sorry to put a hand
to the transaction.&nbsp; I appeal to you in this difficulty for
information.&nbsp; I must learn what is at the bottom of it
all.&nbsp; If you do not know, cannot guess, or are not at
liberty to tell me, I shall take my hat and go back to my bank as
came.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know,&rdquo; answered the lawyer, &ldquo;but I
have an excellent guess.&nbsp; Your father, and no one else, is
at the root of this apparently unnatural business.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&rdquo; cried Francis, in extreme
disdain.&nbsp; &ldquo;Worthy man, I know every thought of his
mind, every penny of his fortune!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You misinterpret my words,&rdquo; said the
lawyer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not refer to Mr. Scrymgeour, senior;
for he is not your father.&nbsp; When he and his wife came to
Edinburgh, you were already nearly one year old, and you had not
yet been three months in their care.&nbsp; The secret has been
well kept; but such is the fact.&nbsp; Your father is unknown,
and I say again that I believe him to be the original of the
offers I am charged at present to transmit to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be impossible to exaggerate the astonishment of
Francis Scrymgeour at this unexpected information.&nbsp; He pled
this confusion to the lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;after a piece of news so
startling, you must grant me some hours for thought.&nbsp; You
shall know this evening what conclusion I have
reached.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lawyer commended his prudence; and Francis, excusing
himself upon some pretext at the bank, took a long walk into the
country, and fully considered the different steps and aspects of
the case.&nbsp; A pleasant sense of his own importance rendered
him the more deliberate: but the issue was from the first not
doubtful.&nbsp; His whole carnal man leaned irresistibly towards
the five hundred a year, and the strange conditions with which it
was burdened; he discovered in his heart an invincible repugnance
to the name of Scrymgeour, which he had never hitherto disliked;
he began to despise the narrow and unromantic interests of his
former life; and when once his mind was fairly made up, he walked
with a new feeling of strength and freedom, and nourished himself
with the gayest anticipations.</p>
<p>He said but a word to the lawyer, and immediately received a
cheque for two quarters&rsquo; arrears; for the allowance was
ante-dated from the first of January.&nbsp; With this in his
pocket, he walked home.&nbsp; The flat in Scotland Street looked
mean in his eyes; his nostrils, for the first time, rebelled
against the odour of broth; and he observed little defects of
manner in his adoptive father which filled him with surprise and
almost with disgust.&nbsp; The next day, he determined, should
see him on his way to Paris.</p>
<p>In that city, where he arrived long before the appointed date,
he put up at a modest hotel frequented by English and Italians,
and devoted himself to improvement in the French tongue; for this
purpose he had a master twice a week, entered into conversation
with loiterers in the Champs Elys&eacute;es, and nightly
frequented the theatre.&nbsp; He had his whole toilette
fashionably renewed; and was shaved and had his hair dressed
every morning by a barber in a neighbouring street.&nbsp; This
gave him something of a foreign air, and seemed to wipe off the
reproach of his past years.</p>
<p>At length, on the Saturday afternoon, he betook himself to the
box-office of the theatre in the Rue Richelieu.&nbsp; No sooner
had he mentioned his name than the clerk produced the order in an
envelope of which the address was scarcely dry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been taken this moment,&rdquo; said the
clerk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask
what the gentleman was like?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your friend is easy to describe,&rdquo; replied the
official.&nbsp; &ldquo;He is old and strong and beautiful, with
white hair and a sabre-cut across his face.&nbsp; You cannot fail
to recognise so marked a person.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; returned Francis; &ldquo;and I thank
you for your politeness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He cannot yet be far distant,&rdquo; added the
clerk.&nbsp; &ldquo;If you make haste you might still overtake
him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis did not wait to be twice told; he ran precipitately
from the theatre into the middle of the street and looked in all
directions.&nbsp; More than one white-haired man was within
sight; but though he overtook each of them in succession, all
wanted the sabre-cut.&nbsp; For nearly half-an-hour he tried one
street after another in the neighbourhood, until at length,
recognising the folly of continued search, he started on a walk
to compose his agitated feelings; for this proximity of an
encounter with him to whom he could not doubt he owed the day had
profoundly moved the young man.</p>
<p>It chanced that his way lay up the Rue Drouot and thence up
the Rue des Martyrs; and chance, in this case, served him better
than all the forethought in the world.&nbsp; For on the outer
boulevard he saw two men in earnest colloquy upon a seat.&nbsp;
One was dark, young, and handsome, secularly dressed, but with an
indelible clerical stamp; the other answered in every particular
to the description given him by the clerk.&nbsp; Francis felt his
heart beat high in his bosom; he knew he was now about to hear
the voice of his father; and making a wide circuit, he
noiselessly took his place behind the couple in question, who
were too much interested in their talk to observe much
else.&nbsp; As Francis had expected, the conversation was
conducted in the English language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your suspicions begin to annoy me, Rolles,&rdquo; said
the older man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell you I am doing my utmost; a
man cannot lay his hand on millions in a moment.&nbsp; Have I not
taken you up, a mere stranger, out of pure good-will?&nbsp; Are
you not living largely on my bounty?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;On your advances, Mr. Vandeleur,&rdquo; corrected the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Advances, if you choose; and interest instead of
goodwill, if you prefer it,&rdquo; returned Vandeleur
angrily.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am not here to pick expressions.&nbsp;
Business is business; and your business, let me remind you, is
too muddy for such airs.&nbsp; Trust me, or leave me alone and
find some one else; but let us have an end, for God&rsquo;s sake,
of your jeremiads.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am beginning to learn the world,&rdquo; replied the
other, &ldquo;and I see that you have every reason to play me
false, and not one to deal honestly.&nbsp; I am not here to pick
expressions either; you wish the diamond for yourself; you know
you do&mdash;you dare not deny it.&nbsp; Have you not already
forged my name, and searched my lodging in my absence?&nbsp; I
understand the cause of your delays; you are lying in wait; you
are the diamond hunter, forsooth; and sooner or later, by fair
means or foul, you&rsquo;ll lay your hands upon it.&nbsp; I tell
you, it must stop; push me much further and I promise you a
surprise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It does not become you to use threats,&rdquo; returned
Vandeleur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Two can play at that.&nbsp; My brother is
here in Paris; the police are on the alert; and if you persist in
wearying me with your caterwauling, I will arrange a little
astonishment for you, Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; But mine shall be once
and for all.&nbsp; Do you understand, or would you prefer me to
tell it you in Hebrew?&nbsp; There is an end to all things, and
you have come to the end of my patience.&nbsp; Tuesday, at seven;
not a day, not an hour sooner, not the least part of a second, if
it were to save your life.&nbsp; And if you do not choose to
wait, you may go to the bottomless pit for me, and
welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so saying, the Dictator arose from the bench, and marched
off in the direction of Montmartre, shaking his head and swinging
his cane with a most furious air; while his companion remained
where he was, in an attitude of great dejection.</p>
<p>Francis was at the pitch of surprise and horror; his
sentiments had been shocked to the last degree; the hopeful
tenderness with which he had taken his place upon the bench was
transformed into repulsion and despair; old Mr. Scrymgeour, he
reflected, was a far more kindly and creditable parent than this
dangerous and violent intriguer; but he retained his presence of
mind, and suffered not a moment to elapse before he was on the
trail of the Dictator.</p>
<p>That gentleman&rsquo;s fury carried him forward at a brisk
pace, and he was so completely occupied in his angry thoughts
that he never so much as cast a look behind him till he reached
his own door.</p>
<p>His house stood high up in the Rue Lepic, commanding a view of
all Paris and enjoying the pure air of the heights.&nbsp; It was
two storeys high, with green blinds and shutters; and all the
windows looking on the street were hermetically closed.&nbsp;
Tops of trees showed over the high garden wall, and the wall was
protected by <i>chevaux-de-frise</i>.&nbsp; The Dictator paused a
moment while he searched his pocket for a key; and then, opening
a gate, disappeared within the enclosure.</p>
<p>Francis looked about him; the neighbourhood was very lonely,
the house isolated in its garden.&nbsp; It seemed as if his
observation must here come to an abrupt end.&nbsp; A second
glance, however, showed him a tall house next door presenting a
gable to the garden, and in this gable a single window.&nbsp; He
passed to the front and saw a ticket offering unfurnished
lodgings by the month; and, on inquiry, the room which commanded
the Dictator&rsquo;s garden proved to be one of those to
let.&nbsp; Francis did not hesitate a moment; he took the room,
paid an advance upon the rent, and returned to his hotel to seek
his baggage.</p>
<p>The old man with the sabre-cut might or might not be his
father; he might or he might not be upon the true scent; but he
was certainly on the edge of an exciting mystery, and he promised
himself that he would not relax his observation until he had got
to the bottom of the secret.</p>
<p>From the window of his new apartment Francis Scrymgeour
commanded a complete view into the garden of the house with the
green blinds.&nbsp; Immediately below him a very comely chestnut
with wide boughs sheltered a pair of rustic tables where people
might dine in the height of summer.&nbsp; On all sides save one a
dense vegetation concealed the soil; but there, between the
tables and the house, he saw a patch of gravel walk leading from
the verandah to the garden-gate.&nbsp; Studying the place from
between the boards of the Venetian shutters, which he durst not
open for fear of attracting attention, Francis observed but
little to indicate the manners of the inhabitants, and that
little argued no more than a close reserve and a taste for
solitude.&nbsp; The garden was conventual, the house had the air
of a prison.&nbsp; The green blinds were all drawn down upon the
outside; the door into the verandah was closed; the garden, as
far as he could see it, was left entirely to itself in the
evening sunshine.&nbsp; A modest curl of smoke from a single
chimney alone testified to the presence of living people.</p>
<p>In order that he might not be entirely idle, and to give a
certain colour to his way of life, Francis had purchased
Euclid&rsquo;s Geometry in French, which he set himself to copy
and translate on the top of his portmanteau and seated on the
floor against the wall; for he was equally without chair or
table.&nbsp; From time to time he would rise and cast a glance
into the enclosure of the house with the green blinds; but the
windows remained obstinately closed and the garden empty.</p>
<p>Only late in the evening did anything occur to reward his
continued attention.&nbsp; Between nine and ten the sharp tinkle
of a bell aroused him from a fit of dozing; and he sprang to his
observatory in time to hear an important noise of locks being
opened and bars removed, and to see Mr. Vandeleur, carrying a
lantern and clothed in a flowing robe of black velvet with a
skull-cap to match, issue from under the verandah and proceed
leisurely towards the garden gate.&nbsp; The sound of bolts and
bars was then repeated; and a moment after Francis perceived the
Dictator escorting into the house, in the mobile light of the
lantern, an individual of the lowest and most despicable
appearance.</p>
<p>Half-an-hour afterwards the visitor was reconducted to the
street; and Mr. Vandeleur, setting his light upon one of the
rustic tables, finished a cigar with great deliberation under the
foliage of the chestnut.&nbsp; Francis, peering through a clear
space among the leaves, was able to follow his gestures as he
threw away the ash or enjoyed a copious inhalation; and beheld a
cloud upon the old man&rsquo;s brow and a forcible action of the
lips, which testified to some deep and probably painful train of
thought.&nbsp; The cigar was already almost at an end, when the
voice of a young girl was heard suddenly crying the hour from the
interior of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In a moment,&rdquo; replied John Vandeleur.</p>
<p>And, with that, he threw away the stump and, taking up the
lantern, sailed away under the verandah for the night.&nbsp; As
soon as the door was closed, absolute darkness fell upon the
house; Francis might try his eyesight as much as he pleased, he
could not detect so much as a single chink of light below a
blind; and he concluded, with great good sense, that the
bed-chambers were all upon the other side.</p>
<p>Early the next morning (for he was early awake after an
uncomfortable night upon the floor), he saw cause to adopt a
different explanation.&nbsp; The blinds rose, one after another,
by means of a spring in the interior, and disclosed steel
shutters such as we see on the front of shops; these in their
turn were rolled up by a similar contrivance; and for the space
of about an hour, the chambers were left open to the morning
air.&nbsp; At the end of that time Mr. Vandeleur, with his own
hand, once more closed the shutters and replaced the blinds from
within.</p>
<p>While Francis was still marvelling at these precautions, the
door opened and a young girl came forth to look about her in the
garden.&nbsp; It was not two minutes before she re-entered the
house, but even in that short time he saw enough to convince him
that she possessed the most unusual attractions.&nbsp; His
curiosity was not only highly excited by this incident, but his
spirits were improved to a still more notable degree.&nbsp; The
alarming manners and more than equivocal life of his father
ceased from that moment to prey upon his mind; from that moment
he embraced his new family with ardour; and whether the young
lady should prove his sister or his wife, he felt convinced she
was an angel in disguise.&nbsp; So much was this the case that he
was seized with a sudden horror when he reflected how little he
really knew, and how possible it was that he had followed the
wrong person when he followed Mr. Vandeleur.</p>
<p>The porter, whom he consulted, could afford him little
information; but, such as it was, it had a mysterious and
questionable sound.&nbsp; The person next door was an English
gentleman of extraordinary wealth, and proportionately eccentric
in his tastes and habits.&nbsp; He possessed great collections,
which he kept in the house beside him; and it was to protect
these that he had fitted the place with steel shutters, elaborate
fastenings, and <i>chevaux-de-frise</i> along the garden
wall.&nbsp; He lived much alone, in spite of some strange
visitors with whom, it seemed, he had business to transact; and
there was no one else in the house, except Mademoiselle and an
old woman servant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is Mademoiselle his daughter?&rdquo; inquired
Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; replied the porter.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mademoiselle is the daughter of the house; and strange it
is to see how she is made to work.&nbsp; For all his riches, it
is she who goes to market; and every day in the week you may see
her going by with a basket on her arm.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the collections?&rdquo; asked the other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;they are immensely
valuable.&nbsp; More I cannot tell you.&nbsp; Since M. de
Vandeleur&rsquo;s arrival no one in the quarter has so much as
passed the door.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suppose not,&rdquo; returned Francis, &ldquo;you must
surely have some notion what these famous galleries
contain.&nbsp; Is it pictures, silks, statues, jewels, or
what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith, sir,&rdquo; said the fellow with a shrug,
&ldquo;it might be carrots, and still I could not tell you.&nbsp;
How should I know?&nbsp; The house is kept like a garrison, as
you perceive.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And then as Francis was returning disappointed to his room,
the porter called him back.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have just remembered, sir,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;M. de Vandeleur has been in all parts of the world, and I
once heard the old woman declare that he had brought many
diamonds back with him.&nbsp; If that be the truth, there must be
a fine show behind those shutters.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By an early hour on Sunday Francis was in his place at the
theatre.&nbsp; The seat which had been taken for him was only two
or three numbers from the left-hand side, and directly opposite
one of the lower boxes.&nbsp; As the seat had been specially
chosen there was doubtless something to be learned from its
position; and he judged by an instinct that the box upon his
right was, in some way or other, to be connected with the drama
in which he ignorantly played a part.&nbsp; Indeed, it was so
situated that its occupants could safely observe him from
beginning to end of the piece, if they were so minded; while,
profiting by the depth, they could screen themselves sufficiently
well from any counter-examination on his side.&nbsp; He promised
himself not to leave it for a moment out of sight; and whilst he
scanned the rest of the theatre, or made a show of attending to
the business of the stage, he always kept a corner of an eye upon
the empty box.</p>
<p>The second act had been some time in progress, and was even
drawing towards a close, when the door opened and two persons
entered and ensconced themselves in the darkest of the
shade.&nbsp; Francis could hardly control his emotion.&nbsp; It
was Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter.&nbsp; The blood came and went
in his arteries and veins with stunning activity; his ears sang;
his head turned.&nbsp; He dared not look lest he should awake
suspicion; his play-bill, which he kept reading from end to end
and over and over again, turned from white to red before his
eyes; and when he cast a glance upon the stage, it seemed
incalculably far away, and he found the voices and gestures of
the actors to the last degree impertinent and absurd.</p>
<p>From time to time he risked a momentary look in the direction
which principally interested him; and once at least he felt
certain that his eyes encountered those of the young girl.&nbsp;
A shock passed over his body, and he saw all the colours of the
rainbow.&nbsp; What would he not have given to overhear what
passed between the Vandeleurs?&nbsp; What would he not have given
for the courage to take up his opera-glass and steadily inspect
their attitude and expression?&nbsp; There, for aught he knew,
his whole life was being decided&mdash;and he not able to
interfere, not able even to follow the debate, but condemned to
sit and suffer where he was, in impotent anxiety.</p>
<p>At last the act came to an end.&nbsp; The curtain fell, and
the people around him began to leave their places, for the
interval.&nbsp; It was only natural that he should follow their
example; and if he did so, it was not only natural but necessary
that he should pass immediately in front of the box in
question.&nbsp; Summoning all his courage, but keeping his eyes
lowered, Francis drew near the spot.&nbsp; His progress was slow,
for the old gentleman before him moved with incredible
deliberation, wheezing as he went.&nbsp; What was he to do?&nbsp;
Should he address the Vandeleurs by name as he went by?&nbsp;
Should he take the flower from his button-hole and throw it into
the box?&nbsp; Should he raise his face and direct one long and
affectionate look upon the lady who was either his sister or his
betrothed?&nbsp; As he found himself thus struggling among so
many alternatives, he had a vision of his old equable existence
in the bank, and was assailed by a thought of regret for the
past.</p>
<p>By this time he had arrived directly opposite the box; and
although he was still undetermined what to do or whether to do
anything, he turned his head and lifted his eyes.&nbsp; No sooner
had he done so than he uttered a cry of disappointment and
remained rooted to the spot.&nbsp; The box was empty.&nbsp;
During his slow advance Mr. Vandeleur and his daughter had
quietly slipped away.</p>
<p>A polite person in his rear reminded him that he was stopping
the path; and he moved on again with mechanical footsteps, and
suffered the crowd to carry him unresisting out of the
theatre.&nbsp; Once in the street, the pressure ceasing, he came
to a halt, and the cool night air speedily restored him to the
possession of his faculties.&nbsp; He was surprised to find that
his head ached violently, and that he remembered not one word of
the two acts which he had witnessed.&nbsp; As the excitement wore
away, it was succeeded by an overweening appetite for sleep, and
he hailed a cab and drove to his lodging in a state of extreme
exhaustion and some disgust of life.</p>
<p>Next morning he lay in wait for Miss Vandeleur on her road to
market, and by eight o&rsquo;clock beheld her stepping down a
lane.&nbsp; She was simply, and even poorly, attired; but in the
carriage of her head and body there was something flexible and
noble that would have lent distinction to the meanest
toilette.&nbsp; Even her basket, so aptly did she carry it,
became her like an ornament.&nbsp; It seemed to Francis, as he
slipped into a doorway, that the sunshine followed and the
shadows fled before her as she walked; and he was conscious, for
the first time, of a bird singing in a cage above the lane.</p>
<p>He suffered her to pass the doorway, and then, coming forth
once more, addressed her by name from behind.&nbsp; &ldquo;Miss
Vandeleur,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>She turned and, when she saw who he was, became deadly
pale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; he continued; &ldquo;Heaven knows I
had no will to startle you; and, indeed, there should be nothing
startling in the presence of one who wishes you so well as I
do.&nbsp; And, believe me, I am acting rather from necessity than
choice.&nbsp; We have many things in common, and I am sadly in
the dark.&nbsp; There is much that I should be doing, and my
hands are tied.&nbsp; I do not know even what to feel, nor who
are my friends and enemies.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She found her voice with an effort.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not know who you are,&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes!&nbsp; Miss Vandeleur, you do,&rdquo; returned
Francis &ldquo;better than I do myself.&nbsp; Indeed, it is on
that, above all, that I seek light.&nbsp; Tell me what you
know,&rdquo; he pleaded.&nbsp; &ldquo;Tell me who I am, who you
are, and how our destinies are intermixed.&nbsp; Give me a little
help with my life, Miss Vandeleur&mdash;only a word or two to
guide me, only the name of my father, if you will&mdash;and I
shall be grateful and content.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not attempt to deceive you,&rdquo; she
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know who you are, but I am not at liberty
to say.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me, at least, that you have forgiven my
presumption, and I shall wait with all the patience I
have,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I am not to know, I must do
without.&nbsp; It is cruel, but I can bear more upon a
push.&nbsp; Only do not add to my troubles the thought that I
have made an enemy of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You did only what was natural,&rdquo; she said,
&ldquo;and I have nothing to forgive you.&nbsp;
Farewell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it to be <i>farewell</i>?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nay, that I do not know myself,&rdquo; she
answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;Farewell for the present, if you
like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with these words she was gone.</p>
<p>Francis returned to his lodging in a state of considerable
commotion of mind.&nbsp; He made the most trifling progress with
his Euclid for that forenoon, and was more often at the window
than at his improvised writing-table.&nbsp; But beyond seeing the
return of Miss Vandeleur, and the meeting between her and her
father, who was smoking a Trichinopoli cigar in the verandah,
there was nothing notable in the neighbourhood of the house with
the green blinds before the time of the mid-day meal.&nbsp; The
young man hastily allayed his appetite in a neighbouring
restaurant, and returned with the speed of unallayed curiosity to
the house in the Rue Lepic.&nbsp; A mounted servant was leading a
saddle-horse to and fro before the garden wall; and the porter of
Francis&rsquo;s lodging was smoking a pipe against the door-post,
absorbed in contemplation of the livery and the steeds.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look!&rdquo; he cried to the young man, &ldquo;what
fine cattle! what an elegant costume!&nbsp; They belong to the
brother of M. de Vandeleur, who is now within upon a visit.&nbsp;
He is a great man, a general, in your country; and you doubtless
know him well by reputation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I confess,&rdquo; returned Francis, &ldquo;that I have
never heard of General Vandeleur before.&nbsp; We have many
officers of that grade, and my pursuits have been exclusively
civil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is he,&rdquo; replied the porter, &ldquo;who lost
the great diamond of the Indies.&nbsp; Of that at least you must
have read often in the papers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As soon as Francis could disengage himself from the porter he
ran upstairs and hurried to the window.&nbsp; Immediately below
the clear space in the chestnut leaves, the two gentlemen were
seated in conversation over a cigar.&nbsp; The General, a red,
military-looking man, offered some traces of a family resemblance
to his brother; he had something of the same features, something,
although very little, of the same free and powerful carriage; but
he was older, smaller, and more common in air; his likeness was
that of a caricature, and he seemed altogether a poor and debile
being by the side of the Dictator.</p>
<p>They spoke in tones so low, leaning over the table with every
appearance of interest, that Francis could catch no more than a
word or two on an occasion.&nbsp; For as little as he heard, he
was convinced that the conversation turned upon himself and his
own career; several times the name of Scrymgeour reached his ear,
for it was easy to distinguish, and still more frequently he
fancied he could distinguish the name Francis.</p>
<p>At length the General, as if in a hot anger, broke forth into
several violent exclamations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Francis Vandeleur!&rdquo; he cried, accentuating the
last word.&nbsp; &ldquo;Francis Vandeleur, I tell you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dictator made a movement of his whole body, half
affirmative, half contemptuous, but his answer was inaudible to
the young man.</p>
<p>Was he the Francis Vandeleur in question? he wondered.&nbsp;
Were they discussing the name under which he was to be
married?&nbsp; Or was the whole affair a dream and a delusion of
his own conceit and self-absorption?</p>
<p>After another interval of inaudible talk, dissension seemed
again to arise between the couple underneath the chestnut, and
again the General raised his voice angrily so as to be audible to
Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My wife?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have done with
my wife for good.&nbsp; I will not hear her name.&nbsp; I am sick
of her very name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he swore aloud and beat the table with his fist.</p>
<p>The Dictator appeared, by his gestures, to pacify him after a
paternal fashion; and a little after he conducted him to the
garden-gate.&nbsp; The pair shook hands affectionately enough;
but as soon as the door had closed behind his visitor, John
Vandeleur fell into a fit of laughter which sounded unkindly and
even devilish in the ears of Francis Scrymgeour.</p>
<p>So another day had passed, and little more learnt.&nbsp; But
the young man remembered that the morrow was Tuesday, and
promised himself some curious discoveries; all might be well, or
all might be ill; he was sure, at least, to glean some curious
information, and, perhaps, by good luck, get at the heart of the
mystery which surrounded his father and his family.</p>
<p>As the hour of the dinner drew near many preparations were
made in the garden of the house with the green blinds.&nbsp; That
table which was partly visible to Francis through the chestnut
leaves was destined to serve as a sideboard, and carried relays
of plates and the materials for salad: the other, which was
almost entirely concealed, had been set apart for the diners, and
Francis could catch glimpses of white cloth and silver plate.</p>
<p>Mr. Rolles arrived, punctual to the minute; he looked like a
man upon his guard, and spoke low and sparingly.&nbsp; The
Dictator, on the other hand, appeared to enjoy an unusual flow of
spirits; his laugh, which was youthful and pleasant to hear,
sounded frequently from the garden; by the modulation and the
changes of his voice it was obvious that he told many droll
stories and imitated the accents of a variety of different
nations; and before he and the young clergyman had finished their
vermouth all feeling of distrust was at an end, and they were
talking together like a pair of school companions.</p>
<p>At length Miss Vandeleur made her appearance, carrying the
soup-tureen.&nbsp; Mr. Rolles ran to offer her assistance which
she laughingly refused; and there was an interchange of
pleasantries among the trio which seemed to have reference to
this primitive manner of waiting by one of the company.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One is more at one&rsquo;s ease,&rdquo; Mr. Vandeleur
was heard to declare.</p>
<p>Next moment they were all three in their places, and Francis
could see as little as he could hear of what passed.&nbsp; But
the dinner seemed to go merrily; there was a perpetual babble of
voices and sound of knives and forks below the chestnut; and
Francis, who had no more than a roll to gnaw, was affected with
envy by the comfort and deliberation of the meal.&nbsp; The party
lingered over one dish after another, and then over a delicate
dessert, with a bottle of old wine carefully uncorked by the hand
of the Dictator himself.&nbsp; As it began to grow dark a lamp
was set upon the table and a couple of candles on the sideboard;
for the night was perfectly pure, starry, and windless.&nbsp;
Light overflowed besides from the door and window in the
verandah, so that the garden was fairly illuminated and the
leaves twinkled in the darkness.</p>
<p>For perhaps the tenth time Miss Vandeleur entered the house;
and on this occasion she returned with the coffee-tray, which she
placed upon the sideboard.&nbsp; At the same moment her father
rose from his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The coffee is my province,&rdquo; Francis heard him
say.</p>
<p>And next moment he saw his supposed father standing by the
sideboard in the light of the candles.</p>
<p>Talking over his shoulder all the while, Mr. Vandeleur poured
out two cups of the brown stimulant, and then, by a rapid act of
prestidigitation, emptied the contents of a tiny phial into the
smaller of the two.&nbsp; The thing was so swiftly done that even
Francis, who looked straight into his face, had hardly time to
perceive the movement before it was completed.&nbsp; And next
instant, and still laughing, Mr. Vandeleur had turned again
towards the table with a cup in either hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ere we have done with this,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we
may expect our famous Hebrew.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It would be impossible to depict the confusion and distress of
Francis Scrymgeour.&nbsp; He saw foul play going forward before
his eyes, and he felt bound to interfere, but knew not how.&nbsp;
It might be a mere pleasantry, and then how should he look if he
were to offer an unnecessary warning?&nbsp; Or again, if it were
serious, the criminal might be his own father, and then how
should he not lament if he were to bring ruin on the author of
his days?&nbsp; For the first time he became conscious of his own
position as a spy.&nbsp; To wait inactive at such a juncture and
with such a conflict of sentiments in his bosom was to suffer the
most acute torture; he clung to the bars of the shutters, his
heart beat fast and with irregularity, and he felt a strong sweat
break forth upon his body.</p>
<p>Several minutes passed.</p>
<p>He seemed to perceive the conversation die away and grow less
and less in vivacity and volume; but still no sign of any
alarming or even notable event.</p>
<p>Suddenly the ring of a glass breaking was followed by a faint
and dull sound, as of a person who should have fallen forward
with his head upon the table.&nbsp; At the same moment a piercing
scream rose from the garden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What have you done?&rdquo; cried Miss Vandeleur.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dictator replied in a violent whisper, so strong and
sibilant that every word was audible to the watcher at the
window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; said Mr. Vandeleur; &ldquo;the man is
as well as I am.&nbsp; Take him by the heels whilst I carry him
by the shoulders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis heard Miss Vandeleur break forth into a passion of
tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear what I say?&rdquo; resumed the Dictator, in
the same tones.&nbsp; &ldquo;Or do you wish to quarrel with
me?&nbsp; I give you your choice, Miss Vandeleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was another pause, and the Dictator spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take that man by the heels,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I must have him brought into the house.&nbsp; If I were a
little younger, I could help myself against the world.&nbsp; But
now that years and dangers are upon me and my hands are weakened,
I must turn to you for aid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a crime,&rdquo; replied the girl.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am your father,&rdquo; said Mr. Vandeleur.</p>
<p>This appeal seemed to produce its effect.&nbsp; A scuffling
noise followed upon the gravel, a chair was overset, and then
Francis saw the father and daughter stagger across the walk and
disappear under the verandah, bearing the inanimate body of Mr.
Rolles embraced about the knees and shoulders.&nbsp; The young
clergyman was limp and pallid, and his head rolled upon his
shoulders at every step.</p>
<p>Was he alive or dead?&nbsp; Francis, in spite of the
Dictator&rsquo;s declaration, inclined to the latter view.&nbsp;
A great crime had been committed; a great calamity had fallen
upon the inhabitants of the house with the green blinds.&nbsp; To
his surprise, Francis found all horror for the deed swallowed up
in sorrow for a girl and an old man whom he judged to be in the
height of peril.&nbsp; A tide of generous feeling swept into his
heart; he, too, would help his father against man and mankind,
against fate and justice; and casting open the shutters he closed
his eyes and threw himself with out-stretched arms into the
foliage of the chestnut.</p>
<p>Branch after branch slipped from his grasp or broke under his
weight; then he caught a stalwart bough under his armpit, and
hung suspended for a second; and then he let himself drop and
fell heavily against the table.&nbsp; A cry of alarm from the
house warned him that his entrance had not been effected
unobserved.&nbsp; He recovered himself with a stagger, and in
three bounds crossed the intervening space and stood before the
door in the verandah.</p>
<p>In a small apartment, carpeted with matting and surrounded by
glazed cabinets full of rare and costly curios, Mr. Vandeleur was
stooping over the body of Mr. Rolles.&nbsp; He raised himself as
Francis entered, and there was an instantaneous passage of
hands.&nbsp; It was the business of a second; as fast as an eye
can wink the thing was done; the young man had not the time to be
sure, but it seemed to him as if the Dictator had taken something
from the curate&rsquo;s breast, looked at it for the least
fraction of time as it lay in his hand, and then suddenly and
swiftly passed it to his daughter.</p>
<p>All this was over while Francis had still one foot upon the
threshold, and the other raised in air.&nbsp; The next instant he
was on his knees to Mr. Vandeleur.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me too help
you.&nbsp; I will do what you wish and ask no questions; I will
obey you with my life; treat me as a son, and you will find I
have a son&rsquo;s devotion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A deplorable explosion of oaths was the Dictator&rsquo;s first
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Son and father?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Father
and son?&nbsp; What d&mdash;d unnatural comedy is all this?&nbsp;
How do you come in my garden?&nbsp; What do you want?&nbsp; And
who, in God&rsquo;s name, are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis, with a stunned and shamefaced aspect, got upon his
feet again, and stood in silence.</p>
<p>Then a light seemed to break upon Mr. Vandeleur, and he
laughed aloud</p>
<p>&ldquo;I see,&rdquo; cried he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is the
Scrymgeour.&nbsp; Very well, Mr. Scrymgeour.&nbsp; Let me tell
you in a few words how you stand.&nbsp; You have entered my
private residence by force, or perhaps by fraud, but certainly
with no encouragement from me; and you come at a moment of some
annoyance, a guest having fainted at my table, to besiege me with
your protestations.&nbsp; You are no son of mine.&nbsp; You are
my brother&rsquo;s bastard by a fishwife, if you want to
know.&nbsp; I regard you with an indifference closely bordering
on aversion; and from what I now see of your conduct, I judge
your mind to be exactly suitable to your exterior.&nbsp; I
recommend you these mortifying reflections for your leisure; and,
in the meantime, let me beseech you to rid us of your
presence.&nbsp; If I were not occupied,&rdquo; added the
Dictator, with a terrifying oath, &ldquo;I should give you the
unholiest drubbing ere you went!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis listened in profound humiliation.&nbsp; He would have
fled had it been possible; but as he had no means of leaving the
residence into which he had so unfortunately penetrated, he could
do no more than stand foolishly where he was.</p>
<p>It was Miss Vandeleur who broke the silence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Father,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you speak in
anger.&nbsp; Mr. Scrymgeour may have been mistaken, but he meant
well and kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you for speaking,&rdquo; returned the
Dictator.&nbsp; &ldquo;You remind me of some other observations
which I hold it a point of honour to make to Mr.
Scrymgeour.&nbsp; My brother,&rdquo; he continued, addressing the
young man, &ldquo;has been foolish enough to give you an
allowance; he was foolish enough and presumptuous enough to
propose a match between you and this young lady.&nbsp; You were
exhibited to her two nights ago; and I rejoice to tell you that
she rejected the idea with disgust.&nbsp; Let me add that I have
considerable influence with your father; and it shall not be my
fault if you are not beggared of your allowance and sent back to
your scrivening ere the week be out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tones of the old man&rsquo;s voice were, if possible, more
wounding than his language; Francis felt himself exposed to the
most cruel, blighting, and unbearable contempt; his head turned,
and he covered his face with his hands, uttering at the same time
a tearless sob of agony.&nbsp; But Miss Vandeleur once again
interfered in his behalf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Scrymgeour,&rdquo; she said, speaking in clear and
even tones, &ldquo;you must not be concerned at my father&rsquo;s
harsh expressions.&nbsp; I felt no disgust for you; on the
contrary, I asked an opportunity to make your better
acquaintance.&nbsp; As for what has passed to-night, believe me
it has filled my mind with both pity and esteem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just then Mr. Rolles made a convulsive movement with his arm,
which convinced Francis that he was only drugged, and was
beginning to throw off the influence of the opiate.&nbsp; Mr.
Vandeleur stooped over him and examined his face for an
instant.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come!&rdquo; cried he, raising his head.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let there be an end of this.&nbsp; And since you are so
pleased with his conduct, Miss Vandeleur, take a candle and show
the bastard out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The young lady hastened to obey.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Francis, as soon as he was alone
with her in the garden.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thank you from my
soul.&nbsp; This has been the bitterest evening of my life, but
it will have always one pleasant recollection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I spoke as I felt,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and in
justice to you.&nbsp; It made my heart sorry that you should be
so unkindly used.&rdquo;</p>
<p>By this time they had reached the garden gate; and Miss
Vandeleur, having set the candle on the ground, was already
unfastening the bolts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One word more,&rdquo; said Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;This
is not for the last time&mdash;I shall see you again, shall I
not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have heard
my father.&nbsp; What can I do but obey?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me at least that it is not with your
consent,&rdquo; returned Francis; &ldquo;tell me that you have no
wish to see the last of me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; replied she, &ldquo;I have none.&nbsp;
You seem to me both brave and honest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Francis, &ldquo;give me a
keepsake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She paused for a moment, with her hand upon the key; for the
various bars and bolts were all undone, and there was nothing
left but to open the lock.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I agree,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;will you promise to
do as I tell you from point to point?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can you ask?&rdquo; replied Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
would do so willingly on your bare word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She turned the key and threw open the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not know
what you ask, but be it so.&nbsp; Whatever you hear,&rdquo; she
continued, &ldquo;whatever happens, do not return to this house;
hurry fast until you reach the lighted and populous quarters of
the city; even there be upon your guard.&nbsp; You are in a
greater danger than you fancy.&nbsp; Promise me you will not so
much as look at my keepsake until you are in a place of
safety.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise,&rdquo; replied Francis.</p>
<p>She put something loosely wrapped in a handkerchief into the
young man&rsquo;s hand; and at the same time, with more strength
than he could have anticipated, she pushed him into the
street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, run!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>He heard the door close behind him, and the noise of the bolts
being replaced.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My faith,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since I have
promised!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he took to his heels down the lane that leads into the Rue
Ravignan.</p>
<p>He was not fifty paces from the house with the green blinds
when the most diabolical outcry suddenly arose out of the
stillness of the night.&nbsp; Mechanically he stood still;
another passenger followed his example; in the neighbouring
floors he saw people crowding to the windows; a conflagration
could not have produced more disturbance in this empty
quarter.&nbsp; And yet it seemed to be all the work of a single
man, roaring between grief and rage, like a lioness robbed of her
whelps; and Francis was surprised and alarmed to hear his own
name shouted with English imprecations to the wind.</p>
<p>His first movement was to return to the house; his second, as
he remembered Miss Vandeleur&rsquo;s advice, to continue his
flight with greater expedition than before; and he was in the act
of turning to put his thought in action, when the Dictator,
bareheaded, bawling aloud, his white hair blowing about his head,
shot past him like a ball out of the cannon&rsquo;s mouth, and
went careering down the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was a close shave,&rdquo; thought Francis to
himself.&nbsp; &ldquo;What he wants with me, and why he should be
so disturbed, I cannot think; but he is plainly not good company
for the moment, and I cannot do better than follow Miss
Vandeleur&rsquo;s advice.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying, he turned to retrace his steps, thinking to double
and descend by the Rue Lepic itself while his pursuer should
continue to follow after him on the other line of street.&nbsp;
The plan was ill-devised: as a matter of fact, he should have
taken his seat in the nearest caf&eacute;, and waited there until
the first heat of the pursuit was over.&nbsp; But besides that
Francis had no experience and little natural aptitude for the
small war of private life, he was so unconscious of any evil on
his part, that he saw nothing to fear beyond a disagreeable
interview.&nbsp; And to disagreeable interviews he felt he had
already served his apprenticeship that evening; nor could he
suppose that Miss Vandeleur had left anything unsaid.&nbsp;
Indeed, the young man was sore both in body and mind&mdash;the
one was all bruised, the other was full of smarting arrows; and
he owned to himself that Mr. Vandeleur was master of a very
deadly tongue.</p>
<p>The thought of his bruises reminded him that he had not only
come without a hat, but that his clothes had considerably
suffered in his descent through the chestnut.&nbsp; At the first
magazine he purchased a cheap wideawake, and had the disorder of
his toilet summarily repaired.&nbsp; The keepsake, still rolled
in the handkerchief, he thrust in the meanwhile into his trousers
pocket.</p>
<p>Not many steps beyond the shop he was conscious of a sudden
shock, a hand upon his throat, an infuriated face close to his
own, and an open mouth bawling curses in his ear.&nbsp; The
Dictator, having found no trace of his quarry, was returning by
the other way.&nbsp; Francis was a stalwart young fellow; but he
was no match for his adversary whether in strength or skill; and
after a few ineffectual struggles he resigned himself entirely to
his captor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will talk of that at home,&rdquo; returned the
Dictator grimly.</p>
<p>And he continued to march the young man up hill in the
direction of the house with the green blinds.</p>
<p>But Francis, although he no longer struggled, was only waiting
an opportunity to make a bold push for freedom.&nbsp; With a
sudden jerk he left the collar of his coat in the hands of Mr.
Vandeleur, and once more made off at his best speed in the
direction of the Boulevards.</p>
<p>The tables were now turned.&nbsp; If the Dictator was the
stronger, Francis, in the top of his youth, was the more fleet of
foot, and he had soon effected his escape among the crowds.&nbsp;
Relieved for a moment, but with a growing sentiment of alarm and
wonder in his mind, be walked briskly until he debouched upon the
Place de l&rsquo;Op&eacute;ra, lit up like day with electric
lamps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This, at least,&rdquo; thought he, &ldquo;should
satisfy Miss Vandeleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And turning to his right along the Boulevards, he entered the
Caf&eacute; Am&eacute;ricain and ordered some beer.&nbsp; It was
both late and early for the majority of the frequenters of the
establishment.&nbsp; Only two or three persons, all men, were
dotted here and there at separate tables in the hall; and Francis
was too much occupied by his own thoughts to observe their
presence.</p>
<p>He drew the handkerchief from his pocket.&nbsp; The object
wrapped in it proved to be a morocco case, clasped and ornamented
in gilt, which opened by means of a spring, and disclosed to the
horrified young man a diamond of monstrous bigness and
extraordinary brilliancy.&nbsp; The circumstance was so
inexplicable, the value of the stone was plainly so enormous,
that Francis sat staring into the open casket without movement,
without conscious thought, like a man stricken suddenly with
idiocy.</p>
<p>A hand was laid upon his shoulder, lightly but firmly, and a
quiet voice, which yet had in it the ring of command, uttered
these words in his ear&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the casket, and compose your face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Looking up, he beheld a man, still young, of an urbane and
tranquil presence, and dressed with rich simplicity.&nbsp; This
personage had risen from a neighbouring table, and, bringing his
glass with him, had taken a seat beside Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Close the casket,&rdquo; repeated the stranger,
&ldquo;and put it quietly back into your pocket, where I feel
persuaded it should never have been.&nbsp; Try, if you please, to
throw off your bewildered air, and act as though I were one of
your acquaintances whom you had met by chance.&nbsp; So!&nbsp;
Touch glasses with me.&nbsp; That is better.&nbsp; I fear, sir,
you must be an amateur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the stranger pronounced these last words with a smile of
peculiar meaning, leaned back in his seat and enjoyed a deep
inhalation of tobacco.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake,&rdquo; said Francis, &ldquo;tell
me who you are and what this means?&nbsp; Why I should obey your
most unusual suggestions I am sure I know not; but the truth is,
I have fallen this evening into so many perplexing adventures,
and all I meet conduct themselves so strangely, that I think I
must either have gone mad or wandered into another planet.&nbsp;
Your face inspires me with confidence; you seem wise, good, and
experienced; tell me, for heaven&rsquo;s sake, why you accost me
in so odd a fashion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;All in due time,&rdquo; replied the stranger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But I have the first hand, and you must begin by telling
me how the Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond is in your
possession.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond!&rdquo; echoed Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would not speak so loud, if I were you,&rdquo;
returned the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;But most certainly you have the
Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond in your pocket.&nbsp; I have seen and
handled it a score of times in Sir Thomas Vandeleur&rsquo;s
collection.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir Thomas Vandeleur!&nbsp; The General!&nbsp; My
father!&rdquo; cried Francis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your father?&rdquo; repeated the stranger.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I was not aware the General had any family.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am illegitimate, sir,&rdquo; replied Francis, with a
flush.</p>
<p>The other bowed with gravity.&nbsp; It was a respectful bow,
as of a man silently apologising to his equal; and Francis felt
relieved and comforted, he scarce knew why.&nbsp; The society of
this person did him good; he seemed to touch firm ground; a
strong feeling of respect grew up in his bosom, and mechanically
he removed his wideawake as though in the presence of a
superior.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I perceive,&rdquo; said the stranger, &ldquo;that your
adventures have not all been peaceful.&nbsp; Your collar is torn,
your face is scratched, you have a cut upon your temple; you
will, perhaps, pardon my curiosity when I ask you to explain how
you came by these injuries, and how you happen to have stolen
property to an enormous value in your pocket.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must differ from you!&rdquo; returned Francis
hotly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I possess no stolen property.&nbsp; And if
you refer to the diamond, it was given to me not an hour ago by
Miss Vandeleur in the Rue Lepic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By Miss Vandeleur of the Rue Lepic!&rdquo; repeated the
other.&nbsp; &ldquo;You interest me more than you suppose.&nbsp;
Pray continue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heavens!&rdquo; cried Francis.</p>
<p>His memory had made a sudden bound.&nbsp; He had seen Mr.
Vandeleur take an article from the breast of his drugged visitor,
and that article, he was now persuaded, was a morocco case.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a light?&rdquo; inquired the stranger.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Listen,&rdquo; replied Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;I know not
who you are, but I believe you to be worthy of confidence and
helpful; I find myself in strange waters; I must have counsel and
support, and since you invite me I shall tell you all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he briefly recounted his experiences since the day when he
was summoned from the bank by his lawyer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yours is indeed a remarkable history,&rdquo; said the
stranger, after the young man had made an end of his narrative;
&ldquo;and your position is full of difficulty and peril.&nbsp;
Many would counsel you to seek out your father, and give the
diamond to him; but I have other views.&nbsp; Waiter!&rdquo; he
cried.</p>
<p>The waiter drew near.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you ask the manager to speak with me a
moment?&rdquo; said he; and Francis observed once more, both in
his tone and manner, the evidence of a habit of command.</p>
<p>The waiter withdrew, and returned in a moment with manager,
who bowed with obsequious respect.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;can I do to serve
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have the goodness,&rdquo; replied the stranger,
indicating Francis, &ldquo;to tell this gentleman my
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have the honour, sir,&rdquo; said the functionary,
addressing young Scrymgeour, &ldquo;to occupy the same table with
His Highness Prince Florizel of Bohemia.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis rose with precipitation, and made a grateful reverence
to the Prince, who bade him resume his seat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; said Florizel, once more addressing
the functionary; &ldquo;I am sorry to have deranged you for so
small a matter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he dismissed him with a movement of his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; added the Prince, turning to Francis,
&ldquo;give me the diamond.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Without a word the casket was handed over.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have done right,&rdquo; said Florizel, &ldquo;your
sentiments have properly inspired you, and you will live to be
grateful for the misfortunes of to-night.&nbsp; A man, Mr.
Scrymgeour, may fall into a thousand perplexities, but if his
heart be upright and his intelligence unclouded, he will issue
from them all without dishonour.&nbsp; Let your mind be at rest;
your affairs are in my hand; and with the aid of heaven I am
strong enough to bring them to a good end.&nbsp; Follow me, if
you please, to my carriage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So saying the Prince arose and, having left a piece of gold
for the waiter, conducted the young man from the caf&eacute; and
along the Boulevard to where an unpretentious brougham and a
couple of servants out of livery awaited his arrival.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This carriage,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is at your
disposal; collect your baggage as rapidly as you can make it
convenient, and my servants will conduct you to a villa in the
neighbourhood of Paris where you can wait in some degree of
comfort until I have had time to arrange your situation.&nbsp;
You will find there a pleasant garden, a library of good authors,
a cook, a cellar, and some good cigars, which I recommend to your
attention.&nbsp; J&eacute;rome,&rdquo; he added, turning to one
of the servants, &ldquo;you have heard what I say; I leave Mr.
Scrymgeour in your charge; you will, I know, be careful of my
friend.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Francis uttered some broken phrases of gratitude.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be time enough to thank me,&rdquo; said the
Prince, &ldquo;when you are acknowledged by your father and
married to Miss Vandeleur.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that the Prince turned away and strolled leisurely in
the direction of Montmartre.&nbsp; He hailed the first passing
cab, gave an address, and a quarter of an hour afterwards, having
discharged the driver some distance lower, he was knocking at Mr.
Vandeleur&rsquo;s garden gate.</p>
<p>It was opened with singular precautions by the Dictator in
person.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must pardon me this late visit, Mr.
Vandeleur,&rdquo; replied the Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness is always welcome,&rdquo; returned Mr.
Vandeleur, stepping back.</p>
<p>The Prince profited by the open space, and without waiting for
his host walked right into the house and opened the door of the
<i>salon</i>.&nbsp; Two people were seated there; one was Miss
Vandeleur, who bore the marks of weeping about her eyes, and was
still shaken from time to time by a sob; in the other the Prince
recognised the young man who had consulted him on literary
matters about a month before, in a club smoking-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good evening, Miss Vandeleur,&rdquo; said Florizel;
&ldquo;you look fatigued.&nbsp; Mr. Rolles, I believe?&nbsp; I
hope you have profited by the study of Gaboriau, Mr.
Rolles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the young clergyman&rsquo;s temper was too much embittered
for speech; and he contented himself with bowing stiffly, and
continued to gnaw his lip.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what good wind,&rdquo; said Mr. Vandeleur, following
his guest, &ldquo;am I to attribute the honour of your
Highness&rsquo;s presence?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am come on business,&rdquo; returned the Prince;
&ldquo;on business with you; as soon as that is settled I shall
request Mr. Rolles to accompany me for a walk.&nbsp; Mr.
Rolles,&rdquo; he added with severity, &ldquo;let me remind you
that I have not yet sat down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The clergyman sprang to his feet with an apology; whereupon
the Prince took an armchair beside the table, handed his hat to
Mr. Vandeleur, his cane to Mr. Rolles, and, leaving them standing
and thus menially employed upon his service, spoke as
follows:&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have come here, as I said, upon business; but, had I
come looking for pleasure, I could not have been more displeased
with my reception nor more dissatisfied with my company.&nbsp;
You, sir,&rdquo; addressing Mr. Rolles, &ldquo;you have treated
your superior in station with discourtesy; you, Vandeleur,
receive me with a smile, but you know right well that your hands
are not yet cleansed from misconduct.&nbsp; I do not desire to be
interrupted, sir,&rdquo; he added imperiously; &ldquo;I am here
to speak, and not to listen; and I have to ask you to hear me
with respect, and to obey punctiliously.&nbsp; At the earliest
possible date your daughter shall be married at the Embassy to my
friend, Francis Scrymgeour, your brother&rsquo;s acknowledged
son.&nbsp; You will oblige me by offering not less than ten
thousand pounds dowry.&nbsp; For yourself, I will indicate to you
in writing a mission of some importance in Siam which I destine
to your care.&nbsp; And now, sir, you will answer me in two words
whether or not you agree to these conditions.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness will pardon me,&rdquo; said Mr.
Vandeleur, &ldquo;and permit me, with all respect, to submit to
him two queries?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The permission is granted,&rdquo; replied the
Prince.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; resumed the Dictator, &ldquo;has
called Mr. Scrymgeour his friend.&nbsp; Believe me, had I known
he was thus honoured, I should have treated him with proportional
respect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You interrogate adroitly,&rdquo; said the Prince;
&ldquo;but it will not serve your turn.&nbsp; You have my
commands; if I had never seen that gentleman before to-night, it
would not render them less absolute.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness interprets my meaning with his usual
subtlety,&rdquo; returned Vandeleur.&nbsp; &ldquo;Once more: I
have, unfortunately, put the police upon the track of Mr.
Scrymgeour on a charge of theft; am I to withdraw or to uphold
the accusation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will please yourself,&rdquo; replied
Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The question is one between your
conscience and the laws of this land.&nbsp; Give me my hat; and
you, Mr. Rolles, give me my cane and follow me.&nbsp; Miss
Vandeleur, I wish you good evening.&nbsp; I judge,&rdquo; he
added to Vandeleur, &ldquo;that your silence means unqualified
assent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I can do no better,&rdquo; replied the old man,
&ldquo;I shall submit; but I warn you openly it shall not be
without a struggle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are old,&rdquo; said the Prince; &ldquo;but years
are disgraceful to the wicked.&nbsp; Your age is more unwise than
the youth of others.&nbsp; Do not provoke me, or you may find me
harder than you dream.&nbsp; This is the first time that I have
fallen across your path in anger; take care that it be the
last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With these words, motioning the clergyman to follow, Florizel
left the apartment and directed his steps towards the garden
gate; and the Dictator, following with a candle, gave them light,
and once more undid the elaborate fastenings with which he sought
to protect himself from intrusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter is no longer present,&rdquo; said the
Prince, turning on the threshold.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let me tell you
that I understand your threats; and you have only to lift your
hand to bring upon yourself sudden and irremediable
ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Dictator made no reply; but as the Prince turned his back
upon him in the lamplight he made a gesture full of menace and
insane fury; and the next moment, slipping round a corner, he was
running at full speed for the nearest cab-stand.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>(<i>Here</i>, says my Arabian, <i>the thread of events is

<h3><a name="page168"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 168</span>THE
ADVENTURE OF PRINCE FLORIZEL AND A DETECTIVE</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Prince Florizel</span> walked with Mr.
Rolles to the door of a small hotel where the latter
resided.&nbsp; They spoke much together, and the clergyman was
more than once affected to tears by the mingled severity and
tenderness of Florizel&rsquo;s reproaches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have made ruin of my life,&rdquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;Help me; tell me what I am to do; I have,
alas! neither the virtues of a priest nor the dexterity of a
rogue.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now that you are humbled,&rdquo; said the Prince,
&ldquo;I command no longer; the repentant have to do with God and
not with princes.&nbsp; But if you will let me advise you, go to
Australia as a colonist, seek menial labour in the open air, and
try to forget that you have ever been a clergyman, or that you
ever set eyes on that accursed stone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Accurst indeed!&rdquo; replied Mr. Rolles.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Where is it now?&nbsp; What further hurt is it not working
for mankind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will do no more evil,&rdquo; returned the
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is here in my pocket.&nbsp; And
this,&rdquo; he added kindly, &ldquo;will show that I place some
faith in your penitence, young as it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Suffer me to touch your hand,&rdquo; pleaded Mr.
Rolles.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied Prince Florizel, &ldquo;not
yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The tone in which he uttered these last words was eloquent in
the ears of the young clergyman; and for some minutes after the
Prince had turned away he stood on the threshold following with
his eyes the retreating figure and invoking the blessing of
heaven upon a man so excellent in counsel.</p>
<p>For several hours the Prince walked alone in unfrequented
streets.&nbsp; His mind was full of concern; what to do with the
diamond, whether to return it to its owner, whom he judged
unworthy of this rare possession, or to take some sweeping and
courageous measure and put it out of the reach of all mankind at
once and for ever, was a problem too grave to be decided in a
moment.&nbsp; The manner in which it had come into his hands
appeared manifestly providential; and as he took out the jewel
and looked at it under the street lamps, its size and surprising
brilliancy inclined him more and more to think of it as of an
unmixed and dangerous evil for the world.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God help me!&rdquo; he thought; &ldquo;if I look at it
much oftener, I shall begin to grow covetous myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At last, though still uncertain in his mind, he turned his
steps towards the small but elegant mansion on the river-side
which had belonged for centuries to his royal family.&nbsp; The
arms of Bohemia are deeply graved over the door and upon the tall
chimneys; passengers have a look into a green court set with the
most costly flowers, and a stork, the only one in Paris, perches
on the gable all day long and keeps a crowd before the
house.&nbsp; Grave servants are seen passing to and fro within;
and from time to time the great gate is thrown open and a
carriage rolls below the arch.&nbsp; For many reasons this
residence was especially dear to the heart of Prince Florizel; he
never drew near to it without enjoying that sentiment of
home-coming so rare in the lives of the great; and on the present
evening he beheld its tall roof and mildly illuminated windows
with unfeigned relief and satisfaction.</p>
<p>As he was approaching the postern door by which he always
entered when alone, a man stepped forth from the shadow and
presented himself with an obeisance in the Prince&rsquo;s
path.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honour of addressing Prince Florizel of
Bohemia?&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Such is my title,&rdquo; replied the Prince.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What do you want with me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; said the man, &ldquo;a detective, and I
have to present your Highness with this billet from the Prefect
of Police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince took the letter and glanced it through by the light
of the street lamp.&nbsp; It was highly apologetic, but requested
him to follow the bearer to the Prefecture without delay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In short,&rdquo; said Florizel, &ldquo;I am
arrested.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; replied the officer,
&ldquo;nothing, I am certain, could be further from the intention
of the Prefect.&nbsp; You will observe that he has not granted a
warrant.&nbsp; It is mere formality, or call it, if you prefer,
an obligation that your Highness lays on the
authorities.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At the same time,&rdquo; asked the Prince, &ldquo;if I
were to refuse to follow you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not conceal from your Highness that a
considerable discretion has been granted me,&rdquo; replied the
detective with a bow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried Florizel, &ldquo;your
effrontery astounds me!&nbsp; Yourself, as an agent, I must
pardon; but your superiors shall dearly smart for their
misconduct.&nbsp; What, have you any idea, is the cause of this
impolitic and unconstitutional act?&nbsp; You will observe that I
have as yet neither refused nor consented, and much may depend on
your prompt and ingenuous answer.&nbsp; Let me remind you,
officer, that this is an affair of some gravity.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness,&rdquo; said the detective humbly,
&ldquo;General Vandeleur and his brother have had the incredible
presumption to accuse you of theft.&nbsp; The famous diamond,
they declare, is in your hands.&nbsp; A word from you in denial
will most amply satisfy the Prefect; nay, I go farther: if your
Highness would so far honour a subaltern as to declare his
ignorance of the matter even to myself, I should ask permission
to retire upon the spot.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Florizel, up to the last moment, had regarded his adventure in
the light of a trifle, only serious upon international
considerations.&nbsp; At the name of Vandeleur the horrible truth
broke upon him in a moment; he was not only arrested, but he was
guilty.&nbsp; This was not only an annoying incident&mdash;it was
a peril to his honour.&nbsp; What was he to say?&nbsp; What was
he to do?&nbsp; The Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond was indeed an accursed
stone; and it seemed as if he were to be the last victim to its
influence.</p>
<p>One thing was certain.&nbsp; He could not give the required
assurance to the detective.&nbsp; He must gain time.</p>
<p>His hesitation had not lasted a second.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Be it so,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;let us walk together
to the Prefecture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The man once more bowed, and proceeded to follow Florizel at a
respectful distance in the rear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Approach,&rdquo; said the Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am in
a humour to talk, and, if I mistake not, now I look at you again,
this is not the first time that we have met.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I count it an honour,&rdquo; replied the officer,
&ldquo;that your Highness should recollect my face.&nbsp; It is
eight years since I had the pleasure of an interview.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To remember faces,&rdquo; returned Florizel, &ldquo;is
as much a part of my profession as it is of yours.&nbsp; Indeed,
rightly looked upon, a Prince and a detective serve in the same
corps.&nbsp; We are both combatants against crime; only mine is
the more lucrative and yours the more dangerous rank, and there
is a sense in which both may be made equally honourable to a good
man.&nbsp; I had rather, strange as you may think it, be a
detective of character and parts than a weak and ignoble
sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your Highness returns good for evil,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;To an act of presumption he replies by the most
amiable condescension.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How do you know,&rdquo; replied Florizel, &ldquo;that I
am not seeking to corrupt you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heaven preserve me from the temptation!&rdquo; cried
the detective.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I applaud your answer,&rdquo; returned the
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is that of a wise and honest man.&nbsp;
The world is a great place and stocked with wealth and beauty,
and there is no limit to the rewards that may be offered.&nbsp;
Such an one who would refuse a million of money may sell his
honour for an empire or the love of a woman; and I myself, who
speak to you, have seen occasions so tempting, provocations so
irresistible to the strength of human virtue, that I have been
glad to tread in your steps and recommend myself to the grace of
God.&nbsp; It is thus, thanks to that modest and becoming habit
alone,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that you and I can walk this town
together with untarnished hearts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had always heard that you were brave,&rdquo; replied
the officer, &ldquo;but I was not aware that you were wise and
pious.&nbsp; You speak the truth, and you speak it with an accent
that moves me to the heart.&nbsp; This world is indeed a place of
trial.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are now,&rdquo; said Florizel, &ldquo;in the middle
of the bridge.&nbsp; Lean your elbows on the parapet and look
over.&nbsp; As the water rushing below, so the passions and
complications of life carry away the honesty of weak men.&nbsp;
Let me tell you a story.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I receive your Highness&rsquo;s commands,&rdquo;
replied the man.</p>
<p>And, imitating the Prince, he leaned against the parapet, and
disposed himself to listen.&nbsp; The city was already sunk in
slumber; had it not been for the infinity of lights and the
outline of buildings on the starry sky, they might have been
alone beside some country river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An officer,&rdquo; began Prince Florizel, &ldquo;a man
of courage and conduct, who had already risen by merit to an
eminent rank, and won not only admiration but respect, visited,
in an unfortunate hour for his peace of mind, the collections of
an Indian Prince.&nbsp; Here he beheld a diamond so extraordinary
for size and beauty that from that instant he had only one desire
in life: honour, reputation, friendship, the love of country, he
was ready to sacrifice all for this lump of sparkling
crystal.&nbsp; For three years he served this semi-barbarian
potentate as Jacob served Laban; he falsified frontiers, he
connived at murders, he unjustly condemned and executed a
brother-officer who had the misfortune to displease the Rajah by
some honest freedoms; lastly, at a time of great danger to his
native land, he betrayed a body of his fellow-soldiers, and
suffered them to be defeated and massacred by thousands.&nbsp; In
the end, he had amassed a magnificent fortune, and brought home
with him the coveted diamond.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Years passed,&rdquo; continued the Prince, &ldquo;and
at length the diamond is accidentally lost.&nbsp; It falls into
the hands of a simple and laborious youth, a student, a minister
of God, just entering on a career of usefulness and even
distinction.&nbsp; Upon him also the spell is cast; he deserts
everything, his holy calling, his studies, and flees with the gem
into a foreign country.&nbsp; The officer has a brother, an
astute, daring, unscrupulous man, who learns the
clergyman&rsquo;s secret.&nbsp; What does he do?&nbsp; Tell his
brother, inform the police?&nbsp; No; upon this man also the
Satanic charm has fallen; he must have the stone for
himself.&nbsp; At the risk of murder, he drugs the young priest
and seizes the prey.&nbsp; And now, by an accident which is not
important to my moral, the jewel passes out of his custody into
that of another, who, terrified at what he sees, gives it into
the keeping of a man in high station and above reproach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The officer&rsquo;s name is Thomas Vandeleur,&rdquo;
continued Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;The stone is called the
Rajah&rsquo;s Diamond.&nbsp; And&rdquo;&mdash;suddenly opening
his hand&mdash;&ldquo;you behold it here before your
eyes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The officer started back with a cry.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have spoken of corruption,&rdquo; said the
Prince.&nbsp; &ldquo;To me this nugget of bright crystal is as
loathsome as though it were crawling with the worms of death; it
is as shocking as though it were compacted out of innocent
blood.&nbsp; I see it here in my hand, and I know it is shining
with hell-fire.&nbsp; I have told you but a hundredth part of its
story; what passed in former ages, to what crimes and treacheries
it incited men of yore, the imagination trembles to conceive; for
years and years it has faithfully served the powers of hell;
enough, I say, of blood, enough of disgrace, enough of broken
lives and friendships; all things come to an end, the evil like
the good; pestilence as well as beautiful music; and as for this
diamond, God forgive me if I do wrong, but its empire ends
to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Prince made a sudden movement with his hand, and the
jewel, describing an arc of light, dived with a splash into the
flowing river.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; said Florizel with gravity.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have slain a cockatrice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God pardon me!&rdquo; cried the detective.&nbsp;
&ldquo;What have you done?&nbsp; I am a ruined man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; returned the Prince with a smile,
&ldquo;that many well-to-do people in this city might envy you
your ruin.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas! your Highness!&rdquo; said the officer,
&ldquo;and you corrupt me after all?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It seems there was no help for it,&rdquo; replied
Florizel.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now let us go forward to the
Prefecture.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Not long after, the marriage of Francis Scrymgeour and Miss
Vandeleur was celebrated in great privacy; and the Prince acted
on that occasion as groomsman.&nbsp; The two Vandeleurs surprised
some rumour of what had happened to the diamond; and their vast
diving operations on the River Seine are the wonder and amusement
of the idle.&nbsp; It is true that through some miscalculation
they have chosen the wrong branch of the river.&nbsp; As for the
Prince, that sublime person, having now served his turn, may go,
along with the <i>Arabian Author</i>, topsy-turvy into
space.&nbsp; But if the reader insists on more specific
information, I am happy to say that a recent revolution hurled
him from the throne of Bohemia, in consequence of his continued
absence and edifying neglect of public business; and that his
Highness now keeps a cigar store in Rupert Street, much
frequented by other foreign refugees.&nbsp; I go there from time
to time to smoke and have a chat, and find him as great a
creature as in the days of his prosperity; he has an Olympian air
behind the counter; and although a sedentary life is beginning to
tell upon his waistcoat, he is probably, take him for all in all,
the handsomest tobacconist in London.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TELLS HOW I CAMPED IN GRADEN SEA-WOOD, AND
BEHELD A LIGHT IN THE PAVILION</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">was</span> a great solitary when I was
young.&nbsp; I made it my pride to keep aloof and suffice for my
own entertainment; and I may say that I had neither friends nor
acquaintances until I met that friend who became my wife and the
mother of my children.&nbsp; With one man only was I on private
terms; this was R. Northmour, Esquire, of Graden Easter, in
Scotland.&nbsp; We had met at college; and though there was not
much liking between us, nor even much intimacy, we were so nearly
of a humour that we could associate with ease to both.&nbsp;
Misanthropes, we believed ourselves to be; but I have thought
since that we were only sulky fellows.&nbsp; It was scarcely a
companionship, but a coexistence in unsociability.&nbsp;
Northmour&rsquo;s exceptional violence of temper made it no easy
affair for him to keep the peace with any one but me; and as he
respected my silent ways, and let me come and go as I pleased, I
could tolerate his presence without concern.&nbsp; I think we
called each other friends.</p>
<p>When Northmour took his degree and I decided to leave the
university without one, he invited me on a long visit to Graden
Easter; and it was thus that I first became acquainted with the
scene of my adventures.&nbsp; The mansion-house of Graden stood
in a bleak stretch of country some three miles from the shore of
the German Ocean.&nbsp; It was as large as a barrack; and as it
had been built of a soft stone, liable to consume in the eager
air of the seaside, it was damp and draughty within and half
ruinous without.&nbsp; It was impossible for two young men to
lodge with comfort in such a dwelling.&nbsp; But there stood in
the northern part of the estate, in a wilderness of links and
blowing sand-hills, and between a plantation and the sea, a small
Pavilion or Belvidere, of modern design, which was exactly suited
to our wants; and in this hermitage, speaking little, reading
much, and rarely associating except at meals, Northmour and I
spent four tempestuous winter months.&nbsp; I might have stayed
longer; but one March night there sprang up between us a dispute,
which rendered my departure necessary.&nbsp; Northmour spoke
hotly, I remember, and I suppose I must have made some tart
rejoinder.&nbsp; He leaped from his chair and grappled me; I had
to fight, without exaggeration, for my life; and it was only with
a great effort that I mastered him, for he was near as strong in
body as myself, and seemed filled with the devil.&nbsp; The next
morning, we met on our usual terms; but I judged it more delicate
to withdraw; nor did he attempt to dissuade me.</p>
<p>It was nine years before I revisited the neighbourhood.&nbsp;
I travelled at that time with a tilt cart, a tent, and a
cooking-stove, tramping all day beside the waggon, and at night,
whenever it was possible, gipsying in a cove of the hills, or by
the side of a wood.&nbsp; I believe I visited in this manner most
of the wild and desolate regions both in England and Scotland;
and, as I had neither friends nor relations, I was troubled with
no correspondence, and had nothing in the nature of headquarters,
unless it was the office of my solicitors, from whom I drew my
income twice a year.&nbsp; It was a life in which I delighted;
and I fully thought to have grown old upon the march, and at last
died in a ditch.</p>
<p>It was my whole business to find desolate corners, where I
could camp without the fear of interruption; and hence, being in
another part of the same shire, I bethought me suddenly of the
Pavilion on the Links.&nbsp; No thoroughfare passed within three
miles of it.&nbsp; The nearest town, and that was but a fisher
village, was at a distance of six or seven.&nbsp; For ten miles
of length, and from a depth varying from three miles to half a
mile, this belt of barren country lay along the sea.&nbsp; The
beach, which was the natural approach, was full of
quicksands.&nbsp; Indeed I may say there is hardly a better place
of concealment in the United Kingdom.&nbsp; I determined to pass
a week in the Sea-Wood of Graden Easter, and making a long stage,
reached it about sundown on a wild September day.</p>
<p>The country, I have said, was mixed sand-hill and links;
<i>links</i> being a Scottish name for sand which has ceased
drifting and become more or less solidly covered with turf.&nbsp;
The Pavilion stood on an even space; a little behind it, the wood
began in a hedge of elders huddled together by the wind; in
front, a few tumbled sand-hills stood between it and the
sea.&nbsp; An outcropping of rock had formed a bastion for the
sand, so that there was here a promontory in the coast-line
between two shallow bays; and just beyond the tides, the rock
again cropped out and formed an islet of small dimensions but
strikingly designed.&nbsp; The quicksands were of great extent at
low water, and had an infamous reputation in the country.&nbsp;
Close in shore, between the islet and the promontory, it was said
they would swallow a man in four minutes and a half; but there
may have been little ground for this precision.&nbsp; The
district was alive with rabbits, and haunted by gulls which made
a continual piping about the pavilion.&nbsp; On summer days the
outlook was bright and even gladsome; but at sundown in
September, with a high wind, and a heavy surf rolling in close
along the links, the place told of nothing but dead mariners and
sea disaster.&nbsp; A ship beating to windward on the horizon,
and a huge truncheon of wreck half buried in the sands at my
feet, completed the innuendo of the scene.</p>
<p>The pavilion&mdash;it had been built by the last proprietor,
Northmour&rsquo;s uncle, a silly and prodigal
virtuoso&mdash;presented little signs of age.&nbsp; It was two
storeys in height, Italian in design, surrounded by a patch of
garden in which nothing had prospered but a few coarse flowers;
and looked, with its shuttered windows, not like a house that had
been deserted, but like one that had never been tenanted by
man.&nbsp; Northmour was plainly from home; whether, as usual,
sulking in the cabin of his yacht, or in one of his fitful and
extravagant appearances in the world of society, I had, of
course, no means of guessing.&nbsp; The place had an air of
solitude that daunted even a solitary like myself; the wind cried
in the chimneys with a strange and wailing note; and it was with
a sense of escape, as if I were going indoors, that I turned away
and, driving my cart before me, entered the skirts of the
wood.</p>
<p>The Sea-Wood of Graden had been planted to shelter the
cultivated fields behind, and check the encroachments of the
blowing sand.&nbsp; As you advanced into it from coastward,
elders were succeeded by other hardy shrubs; but the timber was
all stunted and bushy; it led a life of conflict; the trees were
accustomed to swing there all night long in fierce winter
tempests; and even in early spring, the leaves were already
flying, and autumn was beginning, in this exposed
plantation.&nbsp; Inland the ground rose into a little hill,
which, along with the islet, served as a sailing mark for
seamen.&nbsp; When the hill was open of the islet to the north,
vessels must bear well to the eastward to clear Graden Ness and
the Graden Bullers.&nbsp; In the lower ground, a streamlet ran
among the trees, and, being dammed with dead leaves and clay of
its own carrying, spread out every here and there, and lay in
stagnant pools.&nbsp; One or two ruined cottages were dotted
about the wood; and, according to Northmour, these were
ecclesiastical foundations, and in their time had sheltered pious
hermits.</p>
<p>I found a den, or small hollow, where there was a spring of
pure water; and there, clearing away the brambles, I pitched the
tent, and made a fire to cook my supper.&nbsp; My horse I
picketed farther in the wood where there was a patch of
sward.&nbsp; The banks of the den not only concealed the light of
my fire, but sheltered me from the wind, which was cold as well
as high.</p>
<p>The life I was leading made me both hardy and frugal.&nbsp; I
never drank but water, and rarely ate anything more costly than
oatmeal; and I required so little sleep, that, although I rose
with the peep of day, I would often lie long awake in the dark or
starry watches of the night.&nbsp; Thus in Graden Sea-Wood,
although I fell thankfully asleep by eight in the evening I was
awake again before eleven with a full possession of my faculties,
and no sense of drowsiness or fatigue.&nbsp; I rose and sat by
the fire, watching the trees and clouds tumultuously tossing and
fleeing overhead, and hearkening to the wind and the rollers
along the shore; till at length, growing weary of inaction, I
quitted the den, and strolled towards the borders of the
wood.&nbsp; A young moon, buried in mist, gave a faint
illumination to my steps; and the light grew brighter as I walked
forth into the links.&nbsp; At the same moment, the wind,
smelling salt of the open ocean and carrying particles of sand,
struck me with its full force, so that I had to bow my head.</p>
<p>When I raised it again to look about me, I was aware of a
light in the pavilion.&nbsp; It was not stationary; but passed
from one window to another, as though some one were reviewing the
different apartments with a lamp or candle.</p>
<p>I watched it for some seconds in great surprise.&nbsp; When I
had arrived in the afternoon the house had been plainly deserted;
now it was as plainly occupied.&nbsp; It was my first idea that a
gang of thieves might have broken in and be now ransacking
Northmour&rsquo;s cupboards, which were many and not ill
supplied.&nbsp; But what should bring thieves to Graden
Easter?&nbsp; And, again, all the shutters had been thrown open,
and it would have been more in the character of such gentry to
close them.&nbsp; I dismissed the notion, and fell back upon
another.&nbsp; Northmour himself must have arrived, and was now
airing and inspecting the pavilion.</p>
<p>I have said that there was no real affection between this man
and me; but, had I loved him like a brother, I was then so much
more in love with solitude that I should none the less have
shunned his company.&nbsp; As it was, I turned and ran for it;
and it was with genuine satisfaction that I found myself safely
back beside the fire.&nbsp; I had escaped an acquaintance; I
should have one more night in comfort.&nbsp; In the morning, I
might either slip away before Northmour was abroad, or pay him as
short a visit as I chose.</p>
<p>But when morning came, I thought the situation so diverting
that I forgot my shyness.&nbsp; Northmour was at my mercy; I
arranged a good practical jest, though I knew well that my
neighbour was not the man to jest with in security; and,
chuckling beforehand over its success, took my place among the
elders at the edge of the wood, whence I could command the door
of the pavilion.&nbsp; The shutters were all once more closed,
which I remember thinking odd; and the house, with its white
walls and green venetians, looked spruce and habitable in the
morning light.&nbsp; Hour after hour passed, and still no sign of
Northmour.&nbsp; I knew him for a sluggard in the morning; but,
as it drew on towards noon, I lost my patience.&nbsp; To say the
truth, I had promised myself to break my fast in the pavilion,
and hunger began to prick me sharply.&nbsp; It was a pity to let
the opportunity go by without some cause for mirth; but the
grosser appetite prevailed, and I relinquished my jest with
regret, and sallied from the wood.</p>
<p>The appearance of the house affected me, as I drew near, with
disquietude.&nbsp; It seemed unchanged since last evening; and I
had expected it, I scarce knew why, to wear some external signs
of habitation.&nbsp; But no: the windows were all closely
shuttered, the chimneys breathed no smoke, and the front door
itself was closely padlocked.&nbsp; Northmour, therefore, had
entered by the back; this was the natural and, indeed, the
necessary conclusion; and you may judge of my surprise when, on
turning the house, I found the back door similarly secured.</p>
<p>My mind at once reverted to the original theory of thieves;
and I blamed myself sharply for my last night&rsquo;s
inaction.&nbsp; I examined all the windows on the lower storey,
but none of them had been tampered with; I tried the padlocks,
but they were both secure.&nbsp; It thus became a problem how the
thieves, if thieves they were, had managed to enter the
house.&nbsp; They must have got, I reasoned, upon the roof of the
outhouse where Northmour used to keep his photographic battery;
and from thence, either by the window of the study or that of my
old bedroom, completed their burglarious entry.</p>
<p>I followed what I supposed was their example; and, getting on
the roof, tried the shutters of each room.&nbsp; Both were
secure; but I was not to be beaten; and, with a little force, one
of them flew open, grazing, as it did so, the back of my
hand.&nbsp; I remember, I put the wound to my mouth, and stood
for perhaps half a minute licking it like a dog, and mechanically
gazing behind me over the waste links and the sea; and, in that
space of time, my eye made note of a large schooner yacht some
miles to the north-east.&nbsp; Then I threw up the window and
climbed in.</p>
<p>I went over the house, and nothing can express my
mystification.&nbsp; There was no sign of disorder, but, on the
contrary, the rooms were unusually clean and pleasant.&nbsp; I
found fires laid, ready for lighting; three bedrooms prepared
with a luxury quite foreign to Northmour&rsquo;s habits, and with
water in the ewers and the beds turned down; a table set for
three in the dining-room; and an ample supply of cold meats,
game, and vegetables on the pantry shelves.&nbsp; There were
guests expected, that was plain; but why guests, when Northmour
hated society?&nbsp; And, above all, why was the house thus
stealthily prepared at dead of night? and why were the shutters
closed and the doors padlocked?</p>
<p>I effaced all traces of my visit, and came forth from the
window feeling sobered and concerned.</p>
<p>The schooner yacht was still in the same place; and it flashed
for a moment through my mind that this might be the <i>Red
Earl</i> bringing the owner of the pavilion and his guests.&nbsp;
But the vessel&rsquo;s head was set the other way.</p>

184</span>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS OF THE NOCTURNAL LANDING FROM THE
YACHT</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">returned</span> to the den to cook
myself a meal, of which I stood in great need, as well as to care
for my horse, whom I had somewhat neglected in the morning.&nbsp;
From time to time I went down to the edge of the wood; but there
was no change in the pavilion, and not a human creature was seen
all day upon the links.&nbsp; The schooner in the offing was the
one touch of life within my range of vision.&nbsp; She,
apparently with no set object, stood off and on or lay to, hour
after hour; but as the evening deepened, she drew steadily
nearer.&nbsp; I became more convinced that she carried Northmour
and his friends, and that they would probably come ashore after
dark; not only because that was of a piece with the secrecy of
the preparations, but because the tide would not have flowed
sufficiently before eleven to cover Graden Floe and the other sea
quags that fortified the shore against invaders.</p>
<p>All day the wind had been going down, and the sea along with
it; but there was a return towards sunset of the heavy weather of
the day before.&nbsp; The night set in pitch dark.&nbsp; The wind
came off the sea in squalls, like the firing of a battery of
cannon; now and then there was a flaw of rain, and the surf
rolled heavier with the rising tide.&nbsp; I was down at my
observatory among the elders, when a light was run up to the
masthead of the schooner, and showed she was closer in than when
I had last seen her by the dying daylight.&nbsp; I concluded that
this must be a signal to Northmour&rsquo;s associates on shore;
and, stepping forth into the links, looked around me for
something in response.</p>
<p>A small footpath ran along the margin of the wood, and formed
the most direct communication between the pavilion and the
mansion-house; and, as I cast my eyes to that side, I saw a spark
of light, not a quarter of a mile away, and rapidly
approaching.&nbsp; From its uneven course it appeared to be the
light of a lantern carried by a person who followed the windings
of the path, and was often staggered and taken aback by the more
violent squalls.&nbsp; I concealed myself once more among the
elders, and waited eagerly for the new-comer&rsquo;s
advance.&nbsp; It proved to be a woman; and, as she passed within
half a rod of my ambush, I was able to recognise the
features.&nbsp; The deaf and silent old dame, who had nursed
Northmour in his childhood, was his associate in this underhand
affair.</p>
<p>I followed her at a little distance, taking advantage of the
innumerable heights and hollows, concealed by the darkness, and
favoured not only by the nurse&rsquo;s deafness, but by the
uproar of the wind and surf.&nbsp; She entered the pavilion, and,
going at once to the upper storey, opened and set a light in one
of the windows that looked towards the sea.&nbsp; Immediately
afterwards the light at the schooner&rsquo;s masthead was run
down and extinguished.&nbsp; Its purpose had been attained, and
those on board were sure that they were expected.&nbsp; The old
woman resumed her preparations; although the other shutters
remained closed, I could see a glimmer going to and fro about the
house; and a gush of sparks from one chimney after another soon
told me that the fires were being kindled.</p>
<p>Northmour and his guests, I was now persuaded, would come
ashore as soon as there was water on the floe.&nbsp; It was a
wild night for boat service; and I felt some alarm mingle with my
curiosity as I reflected on the danger of the landing.&nbsp; My
old acquaintance, it was true, was the most eccentric of men; but
the present eccentricity was both disquieting and lugubrious to
consider.&nbsp; A variety of feelings thus led me towards the
beach, where I lay flat on my face in a hollow within six feet of
the track that led to the pavilion.&nbsp; Thence, I should have
the satisfaction of recognising the arrivals, and, if they should
prove to be acquaintances, greeting them as soon as they had
landed.</p>
<p>Some time before eleven, while the tide was still dangerously
low, a boat&rsquo;s lantern appeared close in shore; and, my
attention being thus awakened, I could perceive another still far
to seaward, violently tossed, and sometimes hidden by the
billows.&nbsp; The weather, which was getting dirtier as the
night went on, and the perilous situation of the yacht upon a lee
shore, had probably driven them to attempt a landing at the
earliest possible moment.</p>
<p>A little afterwards, four yachtsmen carrying a very heavy
chest, and guided by a fifth with a lantern, passed close in
front of me as I lay, and were admitted to the pavilion by the
nurse.&nbsp; They returned to the beach, and passed me a second
time with another chest, larger but apparently not so heavy as
the first.&nbsp; A third time they made the transit; and on this
occasion one of the yachtsmen carried a leather portmanteau, and
the others a lady&rsquo;s trunk and carriage bag.&nbsp; My
curiosity was sharply excited.&nbsp; If a woman were among the
guests of Northmour, it would show a change in his habits and an
apostasy from his pet theories of life, well calculated to fill
me with surprise.&nbsp; When he and I dwelt there together, the
pavilion had been a temple of misogyny.&nbsp; And now, one of the
detested sex was to be installed under its roof.&nbsp; I
remembered one or two particulars, a few notes of daintiness and
almost of coquetry which had struck me the day before as I
surveyed the preparations in the house; their purpose was now
clear, and I thought myself dull not to have perceived it from
the first.</p>
<p>While I was thus reflecting, a second lantern drew near me
from the beach.&nbsp; It was carried by a yachtsman whom I had
not yet seen, and who was conducting two other persons to the
pavilion.&nbsp; These two persons were unquestionably the guests
for whom the house was made ready; and, straining eye and ear, I
set myself to watch them as they passed.&nbsp; One was an
unusually tall man, in a travelling hat slouched over his eyes,
and a highland cape closely buttoned and turned up so as to
conceal his face.&nbsp; You could make out no more of him than
that he was, as I have said, unusually tall, and walked feebly
with a heavy stoop.&nbsp; By his side, and either clinging to him
or giving him support&mdash;I could not make out which&mdash;was
a young, tall, and slender figure of a woman.&nbsp; She was
extremely pale; but in the light of the lantern her face was so
marred by strong and changing shadows, that she might equally
well have been as ugly as sin or as beautiful as I afterwards
found her to be.</p>
<p>When they were just abreast of me, the girl made some remark
which was drowned by the noise of the wind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo; said her companion; and there was
something in the tone with which the word was uttered that
thrilled and rather shook my spirits.&nbsp; It seemed to breathe
from a bosom labouring under the deadliest terror; I have never
heard another syllable so expressive; and I still hear it again
when I am feverish at night, and my mind runs upon old
times.&nbsp; The man turned towards the girl as he spoke; I had a
glimpse of much red beard and a nose which seemed to have been
broken in youth; and his light eyes seemed shining in his face
with some strong and unpleasant emotion.</p>
<p>But these two passed on and were admitted in their turn to the
pavilion.</p>
<p>One by one, or in groups, the seamen returned to the
beach.&nbsp; The wind brought me the sound of a rough voice
crying, &ldquo;Shove off!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, after a pause,
another lantern drew near.&nbsp; It was Northmour alone.</p>
<p>My wife and I, a man and a woman, have often agreed to wonder
how a person could be, at the same time, so handsome and so
repulsive as Northmour.&nbsp; He had the appearance of a finished
gentleman; his face bore every mark of intelligence and courage;
but you had only to look at him, even in his most amiable moment,
to see that he had the temper of a slaver captain.&nbsp; I never
knew a character that was both explosive and revengeful to the
same degree; he combined the vivacity of the south with the
sustained and deadly hatreds of the north; and both traits were
plainly written on his face, which was a sort of danger
signal.&nbsp; In person he was tall, strong, and active; his hair
and complexion very dark; his features handsomely designed, but
spoiled by a menacing expression.</p>
<p>At that moment he was somewhat paler than by nature; he wore a
heavy frown; and his lips worked, and he looked sharply round him
as he walked, like a man besieged with apprehensions.&nbsp; And
yet I thought he had a look of triumph underlying all, as though
he had already done much, and was near the end of an
achievement.</p>
<p>Partly from a scruple of delicacy&mdash;which I dare say came
too late&mdash;partly from the pleasure of startling an
acquaintance, I desired to make my presence known to him without
delay.</p>
<p>I got suddenly to my feet, and stepped forward.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Northmour!&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>I have never had so shocking a surprise in all my days.&nbsp;
He leaped on me without a word; something shone in his hand; and
he struck for my heart with a dagger.&nbsp; At the same moment I
knocked him head over heels.&nbsp; Whether it was my quickness,
or his own uncertainty, I know not; but the blade only grazed my
shoulder, while the hilt and his fist struck me violently on the
mouth.</p>
<p>I fled, but not far.&nbsp; I had often and often observed the
capabilities of the sand-hills for protracted ambush or stealthy
advances and retreats; and, not ten yards from the scene of the
scuffle, plumped down again upon the grass.&nbsp; The lantern had
fallen and gone out.&nbsp; But what was my astonishment to see
Northmour slip at a bound into the pavilion, and hear him bar the
door behind him with a clang of iron!</p>
<p>He had not pursued me.&nbsp; He had run away.&nbsp; Northmour,
whom I knew for the most implacable and daring of men, had run
away!&nbsp; I could scarce believe my reason; and yet in this
strange business, where all was incredible, there was nothing to
make a work about in an incredibility more or less.&nbsp; For why
was the pavilion secretly prepared?&nbsp; Why had Northmour
landed with his guests at dead of night, in half a gale of wind,
and with the floe scarce covered?&nbsp; Why had he sought to kill
me?&nbsp; Had he not recognised my voice?&nbsp; I wondered.&nbsp;
And, above all, how had he come to have a dagger ready in his
hand?&nbsp; A dagger, or even a sharp knife, seemed out of
keeping with the age in which we lived; and a gentleman landing
from his yacht on the shore of his own estate, even although it
was at night and with some mysterious circumstances, does not
usually, as a matter of fact, walk thus prepared for deadly
onslaught.&nbsp; The more I reflected, the further I felt at
sea.&nbsp; I recapitulated the elements of mystery, counting them
on my fingers: the pavilion secretly prepared for guests; the
guests landed at the risk of their lives and to the imminent
peril of the yacht; the guests, or at least one of them, in
undisguised and seemingly causeless terror; Northmour with a
naked weapon; Northmour stabbing his most intimate acquaintance
at a word; last, and not least strange, Northmour fleeing from
the man whom he had sought to murder, and barricading himself,
like a hunted creature, behind the door of the pavilion.&nbsp;
Here were at least six separate causes for extreme surprise; each
part and parcel with the others, and forming all together one
consistent story.&nbsp; I felt almost ashamed to believe my own
senses.</p>
<p>As I thus stood, transfixed with wonder, I began to grow
painfully conscious of the injuries I had received in the
scuffle; skulked round among the sand-hills; and, by a devious
path, regained the shelter of the wood.&nbsp; On the way, the old
nurse passed again within several yards of me, still carrying her
lantern, on the return journey to the mansion-house of
Graden.&nbsp; This made a seventh suspicious feature in the
case&mdash;Northmour and his guests, it appeared, were to cook
and do the cleaning for themselves, while the old woman continued
to inhabit the big empty barrack among the policies.&nbsp; There
must surely be great cause for secrecy, when so many
inconveniences were confronted to preserve it.</p>
<p>So thinking, I made my way to the den.&nbsp; For greater
security, I trod out the embers of the fire, and lit my lantern
to examine the wound upon my shoulder.&nbsp; It was a trifling
hurt, although it bled somewhat freely, and I dressed it as well
as I could (for its position made it difficult to reach) with
some rag and cold water from the spring.&nbsp; While I was thus
busied, I mentally declared war against Northmour and his
mystery.&nbsp; I am not an angry man by nature, and I believe
there was more curiosity than resentment in my heart.&nbsp; But
war I certainly declared; and, by way of preparation, I got out
my revolver, and, having drawn the charges, cleaned and reloaded
it with scrupulous care.&nbsp; Next I became preoccupied about my
horse.&nbsp; It might break loose, or fall to neighing, and so
betray my camp in the Sea-Wood.&nbsp; I determined to rid myself
of its neighbourhood; and long before dawn I was leading it over
the links in the direction of the fisher village.</p>

191</span>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS HOW I BECAME ACQUAINTED WITH MY
WIFE</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">For</span> two days I skulked round the
pavilion, profiting by the uneven surface of the links.&nbsp; I
became an adept in the necessary tactics.&nbsp; These low
hillocks and shallow dells, running one into another, became a
kind of cloak of darkness for my enthralling, but perhaps
dishonourable, pursuit.&nbsp; Yet, in spite of this advantage, I
could learn but little of Northmour or his guests.</p>
<p>Fresh provisions were brought under cover of darkness by the
old woman from the mansion-house.&nbsp; Northmour, and the young
lady, sometimes together, but more often singly, would walk for
an hour or two at a time on the beach beside the quicksand.&nbsp;
I could not but conclude that this promenade was chosen with an
eye to secrecy; for the spot was open only to the seaward.&nbsp;
But it suited me not less excellently; the highest and most
accidented of the sand-hills immediately adjoined; and from
these, lying flat in a hollow, I could overlook Northmour or the
young lady as they walked.</p>
<p>The tall man seemed to have disappeared.&nbsp; Not only did he
never cross the threshold, but he never so much as showed face at
a window; or, at least, not so far as I could see; for I dared
not creep forward beyond a certain distance in the day, since the
upper floor commanded the bottoms of the links; and at night,
when I could venture farther, the lower windows were barricaded
as if to stand a siege.&nbsp; Sometimes I thought the tall man
must be confined to bed, for I remembered the feebleness of his
gait; and sometimes I thought he must have gone clear away, and
that Northmour and the young lady remained alone together in the
pavilion.&nbsp; The idea, even then, displeased me.</p>
<p>Whether or not this pair were man and wife, I had seen
abundant reason to doubt the friendliness of their
relation.&nbsp; Although I could hear nothing of what they said,
and rarely so much as glean a decided expression on the face of
either, there was a distance, almost a stiffness, in their
bearing which showed them to be either unfamiliar or at
enmity.&nbsp; The girl walked faster when she was with Northmour
than when she was alone; and I conceived that any inclination
between a man and a woman would rather delay than accelerate the
step.&nbsp; Moreover, she kept a good yard free of him, and
trailed her umbrella, as if it were a barrier, on the side
between them.&nbsp; Northmour kept sidling closer; and, as the
girl retired from his advance, their course lay at a sort of
diagonal across the beach, and would have landed them in the surf
had it been long enough continued.&nbsp; But, when this was
imminent, the girl would unostentatiously change sides and put
Northmour between her and the sea.&nbsp; I watched these
man&oelig;uvres, for my part, with high enjoyment and approval,
and chuckled to myself at every move.</p>
<p>On the morning of the third day, she walked alone for some
time, and I perceived, to my great concern, that she was more
than once in tears.&nbsp; You will see that my heart was already
interested more than I supposed.&nbsp; She had a firm yet airy
motion of the body, and carried her head with unimaginable grace;
every step was a thing to look at, and she seemed in my eyes to
breathe sweetness and distinction.</p>
<p>The day was so agreeable, being calm and sunshiny, with a
tranquil sea, and yet with a healthful piquancy and vigour in the
air, that, contrary to custom, she was tempted forth a second
time to walk.&nbsp; On this occasion she was accompanied by
Northmour, and they had been but a short while on the beach, when
I saw him take forcible possession of her hand.&nbsp; She
struggled, and uttered a cry that was almost a scream.&nbsp; I
sprang to my feet, unmindful of my strange position; but, ere I
had taken a step, I saw Northmour bareheaded and bowing very low,
as if to apologise; and dropped again at once into my
ambush.&nbsp; A few words were interchanged; and then, with
another bow, he left the beach to return to the pavilion.&nbsp;
He passed not far from me, and I could see him, flushed and
lowering, and cutting savagely with his cane among the
grass.&nbsp; It was not without satisfaction that I recognised my
own handiwork in a great cut under his right eye, and a
considerable discolouration round the socket.</p>
<p>For some time the girl remained where he had left her, looking
out past the islet and over the bright sea.&nbsp; Then with a
start, as one who throws off preoccupation and puts energy again
upon its mettle, she broke into a rapid and decisive walk.&nbsp;
She also was much incensed by what had passed.&nbsp; She had
forgotten where she was.&nbsp; And I beheld her walk straight
into the borders of the quicksand where it is most abrupt and
dangerous.&nbsp; Two or three steps farther and her life would
have been in serious jeopardy, when I slid down the face of the
sand-hill, which is there precipitous, and, running half-way
forward, called to her to stop.</p>
<p>She did so, and turned round.&nbsp; There was not a tremor of
fear in her behaviour, and she marched directly up to me like a
queen.&nbsp; I was barefoot, and clad like a common sailor, save
for an Egyptian scarf round my waist; and she probably took me at
first for some one from the fisher village, straying after
bait.&nbsp; As for her, when I thus saw her face to face, her
eyes set steadily and imperiously upon mine, I was filled with
admiration and astonishment, and thought her even more beautiful
than I had looked to find her.&nbsp; Nor could I think enough of
one who, acting with so much boldness, yet preserved a maidenly
air that was both quaint and engaging; for my wife kept an
old-fashioned precision of manner through all her admirable
life&mdash;an excellent thing in woman, since it sets another
value on her sweet familiarities.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What does this mean?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were walking,&rdquo; I told her, &ldquo;directly
into Graden Floe.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not belong to these parts,&rdquo; she said
again.&nbsp; &ldquo;You speak like an educated man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I have right to that name,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;although in this disguise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But her woman&rsquo;s eye had already detected the sash.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;your sash betrays
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have said the word <i>betray</i>,&rdquo; I
resumed.&nbsp; &ldquo;May I ask you not to betray me?&nbsp; I was
obliged to disclose myself in your interest; but if Northmour
learned my presence it might be worse than disagreeable for
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;to whom you are
speaking?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not to Mr. Northmour&rsquo;s wife?&rdquo; I asked, by
way of answer.</p>
<p>She shook her head.&nbsp; All this while she was studying my
face with an embarrassing intentness.&nbsp; Then she broke
out&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an honest face.&nbsp; Be honest like your
face, sir, and tell me what you want and what you are afraid
of.&nbsp; Do you think I could hurt you?&nbsp; I believe you have
far more power to injure me!&nbsp; And yet you do not look
unkind.&nbsp; What do you mean&mdash;you, a gentleman&mdash;by
skulking like a spy about this desolate place?&nbsp; Tell
me,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;who is it you hate?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hate no one,&rdquo; I answered; &ldquo;and I fear no
one face to face.&nbsp; My name is Cassilis&mdash;Frank
Cassilis.&nbsp; I lead the life of a vagabond for my own good
pleasure.&nbsp; I am one of Northmour&rsquo;s oldest friends; and
three nights ago, when I addressed him on these links, he stabbed
me in the shoulder with a knife.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was you!&rdquo; she said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why he did so,&rdquo; I continued, disregarding the
interruption, &ldquo;is more than I can guess, and more than I
care to know.&nbsp; I have not many friends, nor am I very
susceptible to friendship; but no man shall drive me from a place
by terror.&nbsp; I had camped in Graden Sea-Wood ere he came; I
camp in it still.&nbsp; If you think I mean harm to you or yours,
madam, the remedy is in your hand.&nbsp; Tell him that my camp is
in the Hemlock Den, and to-night he can stab me in safety while I
sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With this I doffed my cap to her, and scrambled up once more
among the sand-hills.&nbsp; I do not know why, but I felt a
prodigious sense of injustice, and felt like a hero and a martyr;
while, as a matter of fact, I had not a word to say in my
defence, nor so much as one plausible reason to offer for my
conduct.&nbsp; I had stayed at Graden out of a curiosity natural
enough, but undignified; and though there was another motive
growing in along with the first, it was not one which, at that
period, I could have properly explained to the lady of my
heart.</p>
<p>Certainly, that night, I thought of no one else; and, though
her whole conduct and position seemed suspicious, I could not
find it in my heart to entertain a doubt of her integrity.&nbsp;
I could have staked my life that she was clear of blame, and,
though all was dark at the present, that the explanation of the
mystery would show her part in these events to be both right and
needful.&nbsp; It was true, let me cudgel my imagination as I
pleased, that I could invent no theory of her relations to
Northmour; but I felt none the less sure of my conclusion because
it was founded on instinct in place of reason, and, as I may say,
went to sleep that night with the thought of her under my
pillow.</p>
<p>Next day she came out about the same hour alone, and, as soon
as the sand-hills concealed her from the pavilion, drew nearer to
the edge, and called me by name in guarded tones.&nbsp; I was
astonished to observe that she was deadly pale, and seemingly
under the influence of strong emotion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cassilis!&rdquo; she cried; &ldquo;Mr.
Cassilis!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I appeared at once, and leaped down upon the beach.&nbsp; A
remarkable air of relief overspread her countenance as soon as
she saw me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; she cried, with a hoarse sound, like one
whose bosom has been lightened of a weight.&nbsp; And then,
&ldquo;Thank God you are still safe!&rdquo; she added; &ldquo;I
knew, if you were, you would be here.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Was not this
strange?&nbsp; So swiftly and wisely does Nature prepare our
hearts for these great life-long intimacies, that both my wife
and I had been given a presentiment on this the second day of our
acquaintance.&nbsp; I had even then hoped that she would seek me;
she had felt sure that she would find me.)&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
not,&rdquo; she went, on swiftly, &ldquo;do not stay in this
place.&nbsp; Promise me that you will sleep no longer in that
wood.&nbsp; You do not know how I suffer; all last night I could
not sleep for thinking of your peril.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Peril?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp; &ldquo;Peril from
whom?&nbsp; From Northmour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not so,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did you think I
would tell him after what you said?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not from Northmour?&rdquo; I repeated.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then how?&nbsp; From whom?&nbsp; I see none to be afraid
of.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not ask me,&rdquo; was her reply, &ldquo;for I
am not free to tell you.&nbsp; Only believe me, and go
hence&mdash;believe me, and go away quickly, quickly, for your
life!&rdquo;</p>
<p>An appeal to his alarm is never a good plan to rid oneself of
a spirited young man.&nbsp; My obstinacy was but increased by
what she said, and I made it a point of honour to remain.&nbsp;
And her solicitude for my safety still more confirmed me in the
resolve.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must not think me inquisitive, madam,&rdquo; I
replied; &ldquo;but, if Graden is so dangerous a place, you
yourself perhaps remain here at some risk.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She only looked at me reproachfully.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You and your father&mdash;&rdquo; I resumed; but she
interrupted me almost with a gasp.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father!&nbsp; How do you know that?&rdquo; she
cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw you together when you landed,&rdquo; was my
answer; and I do not know why, but it seemed satisfactory to both
of us, as indeed it was the truth.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; I
continued, &ldquo;you need have no fear from me.&nbsp; I see you
have some reason to be secret, and, you may believe me, your
secret is as safe with me as if I were in Graden Floe.&nbsp; I
have scarce spoken to any one for years; my horse is my only
companion, and even he, poor beast, is not beside me.&nbsp; You
see, then, you may count on me for silence.&nbsp; So tell me the
truth, my dear young lady, are you not in danger?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Northmour says you are an honourable man,&rdquo;
she returned, &ldquo;and I believe it when I see you.&nbsp; I
will tell you so much; you are right; we are in dreadful,
dreadful danger, and you share it by remaining where you
are.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;you have heard of me from
Northmour?&nbsp; And he gives me a good character?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I asked him about you last night,&rdquo; was her
reply.&nbsp; &ldquo;I pretended,&rdquo; she hesitated, &ldquo;I
pretended to have met you long ago, and spoken to you of
him.&nbsp; It was not true; but I could not help myself without
betraying you, and you had put me in a difficulty.&nbsp; He
praised you highly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And&mdash;you may permit me one question&mdash;does
this danger come from Northmour?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;From Mr. Northmour?&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh
no; he stays with us to share it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;While you propose that I should run away?&rdquo; I
said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You do not rate me very high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why should you stay?&rdquo; she asked.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
are no friend of ours.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I know not what came over me, for I had not been conscious of
a similar weakness since I was a child, but I was so mortified by
this retort that my eyes pricked and filled with tears, as I
continued to gaze upon her face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; she said, in a changed voice; &ldquo;I
did not mean the words unkindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was I who offended,&rdquo; I said; and I held out my
hand with a look of appeal that somehow touched her, for she gave
me hers at once, and even eagerly.&nbsp; I held it for awhile in
mine, and gazed into her eyes.&nbsp; It was she who first tore
her hand away, and, forgetting all about her request and the
promise she had sought to extort, ran at the top of her speed,
and without turning, till she was out of sight.</p>
<p>And then I knew that I loved her, and thought in my glad heart
that she&mdash;she herself&mdash;was not indifferent to my
suit.&nbsp; Many a time she has denied it in after days, but it
was with a smiling and not a serious denial.&nbsp; For my part, I
am sure our hands would not have lain so closely in each other if
she had not begun to melt to me already.&nbsp; And, when all is
said, it is no great contention, since, by her own avowal, she
began to love me on the morrow.</p>
<p>And yet on the morrow very little took place.&nbsp; She came
and called me down as on the day before, upbraided me for
lingering at Graden, and, when she found I was still obdurate,
began to ask me more particularly as to my arrival.&nbsp; I told
her by what series of accidents I had come to witness their
disembarkation, and how I had determined to remain, partly from
the interest which had been wakened in me by Northmour&rsquo;s
guests, and partly because of his own murderous attack.&nbsp; As
to the former, I fear I was disingenuous, and led her to regard
herself as having been an attraction to me from the first moment
that I saw her on the links.&nbsp; It relieves my heart to make
this confession even now, when my wife is with God, and already
knows all things, and the honesty of my purpose even in this; for
while she lived, although it often pricked my conscience, I had
never the hardihood to undeceive her.&nbsp; Even a little secret,
in such a married life as ours, is like the rose-leaf which kept
the Princess from her sleep.</p>
<p>From this the talk branched into other subjects, and I told
her much about my lonely and wandering existence; she, for her
part, giving ear, and saying little.&nbsp; Although we spoke very
naturally, and latterly on topics that might seem indifferent, we
were both sweetly agitated.&nbsp; Too soon it was time for her to
go; and we separated, as if by mutual consent, without shaking
hands, for both knew that, between us, it was no idle
ceremony.</p>
<p>The next, and that was the fourth day of our acquaintance, we
met in the same spot, but early in the morning, with much
familiarity and yet much timidity on either side.&nbsp; When she
had once more spoken about my danger&mdash;and that, I
understood, was her excuse for coming&mdash;I, who had prepared a
great deal of talk during the night, began to tell her how highly
I valued her kind interest, and how no one had ever cared to hear
about my life, nor had I ever cared to relate it, before
yesterday.&nbsp; Suddenly she interrupted me, saying with
vehemence&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet, if you knew who I was, you would not so much
as speak to me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I told her such a thought was madness, and, little as we had
met, I counted her already a dear friend; but my protestations
seemed only to make her more desperate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My father is in hiding!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; I said, forgetting for the first time
to add &ldquo;young lady,&rdquo; &ldquo;what do I care?&nbsp; If
he were in hiding twenty times over, would it make one thought of
change in you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, but the cause!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;the
cause!&nbsp; It is&mdash;&rdquo; she faltered for a
second&mdash;&ldquo;it is disgraceful to us!&rdquo;</p>

200</span>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS IN WHAT A STARTLING MANNER I LEARNED
THAT I WAS NOT ALONE IN GRADEN SEA-WOOD</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">This</span> was my wife&rsquo;s story, as
I drew it from her among tears and sobs.&nbsp; Her name was Clara
Huddlestone: it sounded very beautiful in my ears; but not so
beautiful as that other name of Clara Cassilis, which she wore
during the longer and, I thank God, the happier portion of her
life.&nbsp; Her father, Bernard Huddlestone, had been a private
banker in a very large way of business.&nbsp; Many years before,
his affairs becoming disordered, he had been led to try
dangerous, and at last criminal, expedients to retrieve himself
from ruin.&nbsp; All was in vain; he became more and more cruelly
involved, and found his honour lost at the same moment with his
fortune.&nbsp; About this period, Northmour had been courting his
daughter with great assiduity, though with small encouragement;
and to him, knowing him thus disposed in his favour, Bernard
Huddlestone turned for help in his extremity.&nbsp; It was not
merely ruin and dishonour, nor merely a legal condemnation, that
the unhappy man had brought upon his head.&nbsp; It seems he
could have gone to prison with a light heart.&nbsp; What he
feared, what kept him awake at night or recalled him from slumber
into frenzy, was some secret, sudden, and unlawful attempt upon
his life.&nbsp; Hence, he desired to bury his existence and
escape to one of the islands in the South Pacific, and it was in
Northmour&rsquo;s yacht, the <i>Red Earl</i>, that he designed to
go.&nbsp; The yacht picked them up clandestinely upon the coast
of Wales, and had once more deposited them at Graden, till she
could be refitted and provisioned for the longer voyage.&nbsp;
Nor could Clara doubt that her hand had been stipulated as the
price of passage.&nbsp; For, although Northmour was neither
unkind nor even discourteous, he had shown himself in several
instances somewhat overbold in speech and manner.</p>
<p>I listened, I need not say, with fixed attention, and put many
questions as to the more mysterious part.&nbsp; It was in
vain.&nbsp; She had no clear idea of what the blow was, nor of
how it was expected to fall.&nbsp; Her father&rsquo;s alarm was
unfeigned and physically prostrating, and he had thought more
than once of making an unconditional surrender to the
police.&nbsp; But the scheme was finally abandoned, for he was
convinced that not even the strength of our English prisons could
shelter him from his pursuers.&nbsp; He had had many affairs with
Italy, and with Italians resident in London, in the later years
of his business; and these last, as Clara fancied, were somehow
connected with the doom that threatened him.&nbsp; He had shown
great terror at the presence of an Italian seaman on board the
<i>Red Earl</i>, and had bitterly and repeatedly accused
Northmour in consequence.&nbsp; The latter had protested that
Beppo (that was the seaman&rsquo;s name) was a capital fellow,
and could be trusted to the death; but Mr. Huddlestone had
continued ever since to declare that all was lost, that it was
only a question of days, and that Beppo would be the ruin of him
yet.</p>
<p>I regarded the whole story as the hallucination of a mind
shaken by calamity.&nbsp; He had suffered heavy loss by his
Italian transactions; and hence the sight of an Italian was
hateful to him, and the principal part in his nightmare would
naturally enough be played by one of that nation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What your father wants,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;is a good
doctor and some calming medicine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But Mr. Northmour?&rdquo; objected your mother.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He is untroubled by losses, and yet he shares in this
terror.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help laughing at what I considered her
simplicity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you have told me
yourself what reward he has to look for.&nbsp; All is fair in
love, you must remember; and if Northmour foments your
father&rsquo;s terrors, it is not at all because he is afraid of
any Italian man, but simply because he is infatuated with a
charming English woman.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She reminded me of his attack upon myself on the night of the
disembarkation, and this I was unable to explain.&nbsp; In short,
and from one thing to another, it was agreed between us, that I
should set out at once for the fisher village, Graden Wester, as
it was called, look up all the newspapers I could find, and see
for myself if there seemed any basis of fact for these continued
alarms.&nbsp; The next morning, at the same hour and place, I was
to make my report to Clara.&nbsp; She said no more on that
occasion about my departure; nor, indeed, did she make it a
secret that she clung to the thought of my proximity as something
helpful and pleasant; and, for my part, I could not have left
her, if she had gone upon her knees to ask it.</p>
<p>I reached Graden Wester before ten in the forenoon; for in
those days I was an excellent pedestrian, and the distance, as I
think I have said, was little over seven miles; fine walking all
the way upon the springy turf.&nbsp; The village is one of the
bleakest on that coast, which is saying much: there is a church
in a hollow; a miserable haven in the rocks, where many boats
have been lost as they returned from fishing; two or three score
of stone houses arranged along the beach and in two streets, one
leading from the harbour, and another striking out from it at
right angles; and, at the corner of these two, a very dark and
cheerless tavern, by way of principal hotel.</p>
<p>I had dressed myself somewhat more suitably to my station in
life, and at once called upon the minister in his little manse
beside the graveyard.&nbsp; He knew me, although it was more than
nine years since we had met; and when I told him that I had been
long upon a walking tour, and was behind with the news, readily
lent me an armful of newspapers, dating from a month back to the
day before.&nbsp; With these I sought the tavern, and, ordering
some breakfast, sat down to study the &ldquo;Huddlestone
Failure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It had been, it appeared, a very flagrant case.&nbsp;
Thousands of persons were reduced to poverty; and one in
particular had blown out his brains as soon as payment was
suspended.&nbsp; It was strange to myself that, while I read
these details, I continued rather to sympathise with Mr.
Huddlestone than with his victims; so complete already was the
empire of my love for my wife.&nbsp; A price was naturally set
upon the banker&rsquo;s head; and, as the case was inexcusable
and the public indignation thoroughly aroused, the unusual figure
of &pound;750 was offered for his capture.&nbsp; He was reported
to have large sums of money in his possession.&nbsp; One day, he
had been heard of in Spain; the next, there was sure intelligence
that he was still lurking between Manchester and Liverpool, or
along the border of Wales; and the day after, a telegram would
announce his arrival in Cuba or Yucatan.&nbsp; But in all this
there was no word of an Italian, nor any sign of mystery.</p>
<p>In the very last paper, however, there was one item not so
clear.&nbsp; The accountants who were charged to verify the
failure had, it seemed, come upon the traces of a very large
number of thousands, which figured for some time in the
transactions of the house of Huddlestone; but which came from
nowhere, and disappeared in the same mysterious fashion.&nbsp; It
was only once referred to by name, and then under the initials
&ldquo;X. X.&rdquo;; but it had plainly been floated for the
first time into the business at a period of great depression some
six years ago.&nbsp; The name of a distinguished Royal personage
had been mentioned by rumour in connection with this sum.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The cowardly desperado&rdquo;&mdash;such, I remember, was
the editorial expression&mdash;was supposed to have escaped with
a large part of this mysterious fund still in his possession.</p>
<p>I was still brooding over the fact, and trying to torture it
into some connection with Mr. Huddlestone&rsquo;s danger, when a
man entered the tavern and asked for some bread and cheese with a
decided foreign accent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Siete Italiano</i>?&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>S&igrave;</i>, <i>signor</i>,&rdquo; was his
reply.</p>
<p>I said it was unusually far north to find one of his
compatriots; at which he shrugged his shoulders, and replied that
a man would go anywhere to find work.&nbsp; What work he could
hope to find at Graden Wester, I was totally unable to conceive;
and the incident struck so unpleasantly upon my mind, that I
asked the landlord, while he was counting me some change, whether
he had ever before seen an Italian in the village.&nbsp; He said
he had once seen some Norwegians, who had been shipwrecked on the
other side of Graden Ness and rescued by the lifeboat from
Cauldhaven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No!&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;but an Italian, like the man
who has just had bread and cheese.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo; cried he, &ldquo;yon black-avised fellow
wi&rsquo; the teeth?&nbsp; Was he an I-talian?&nbsp; Weel,
yon&rsquo;s the first that ever I saw, an&rsquo; I dare say
he&rsquo;s like to be the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Even as he was speaking, I raised my eyes, and, casting a
glance into the street, beheld three men in earnest conversation
together, and not thirty yards away.&nbsp; One of them was my
recent companion in the tavern parlour; the other two, by their
handsome, sallow features and soft hats, should evidently belong
to the same race.&nbsp; A crowd of village children stood around
them, gesticulating and talking gibberish in imitation.&nbsp; The
trio looked singularly foreign to the bleak dirty street in which
they were standing, and the dark grey heaven that overspread
them; and I confess my incredulity received at that moment a
shock from which it never recovered.&nbsp; I might reason with
myself as I pleased, but I could not argue down the effect of
what I had seen, and I began to share in the Italian terror.</p>
<p>It was already drawing towards the close of the day before I
had returned the newspapers at the manse, and got well forward on
to the links on my way home.&nbsp; I shall never forget that
walk.&nbsp; It grew very cold and boisterous; the wind sang in
the short grass about my feet; thin rain showers came running on
the gusts; and an immense mountain range of clouds began to arise
out of the bosom of the sea.&nbsp; It would be hard to imagine a
more dismal evening; and whether it was from these external
influences, or because my nerves were already affected by what I
had heard and seen, my thoughts were as gloomy as the
weather.</p>
<p>The upper windows of the pavilion commanded a considerable
spread of links in the direction of Graden Wester.&nbsp; To avoid
observation, it was necessary to hug the beach until I had gained
cover from the higher sand-hills on the little headland, when I
might strike across, through the hollows, for the margin of the
wood.&nbsp; The sun was about setting; the tide was low, and all
the quicksands uncovered; and I was moving along, lost in
unpleasant thought, when I was suddenly thunderstruck to perceive
the prints of human feet.&nbsp; They ran parallel to my own
course, but low down upon the beach instead of along the border
of the turf; and, when I examined them, I saw at once, by the
size and coarseness of the impression, that it was a stranger to
me and to those in the pavilion who had recently passed that
way.&nbsp; Not only so; but from the recklessness of the course
which he had followed, steering near to the most formidable
portions of the sand, he was as evidently a stranger to the
country and to the ill-repute of Graden beach.</p>
<p>Step by step I followed the prints; until, a quarter of a mile
farther, I beheld them die away into the south-eastern boundary
of Graden Floe.&nbsp; There, whoever he was, the miserable man
had perished.&nbsp; One or two gulls, who had, perhaps, seen him
disappear, wheeled over his sepulchre with their usual melancholy
piping.&nbsp; The sun had broken through the clouds by a last
effort, and coloured the wide level of quicksands with a dusky
purple.&nbsp; I stood for some time gazing at the spot, chilled
and disheartened by my own reflections, and with a strong and
commanding consciousness of death.&nbsp; I remember wondering how
long the tragedy had taken, and whether his screams had been
audible at the pavilion.&nbsp; And then, making a strong
resolution, I was about to tear myself away, when a gust fiercer
than usual fell upon this quarter of the beach, and I saw now,
whirling high in air, now skimming lightly across the surface of
the sands, a soft, black, felt hat, somewhat conical in shape,
such as I had remarked already on the heads of the Italians.</p>
<p>I believe, but I am not sure, that I uttered a cry.&nbsp; The
wind was driving the hat shoreward, and I ran round the border of
the floe to be ready against its arrival.&nbsp; The gust fell,
dropping the hat for a while upon the quicksand, and then, once
more freshening, landed it a few yards from where I stood.&nbsp;
I seized it with the interest you may imagine.&nbsp; It had seen
some service; indeed, it was rustier than either of those I had
seen that day upon the street.&nbsp; The lining was red, stamped
with the name of the maker, which I have forgotten, and that of
the place of manufacture, <i>Venedig</i>.&nbsp; This (it is not
yet forgotten) was the name given by the Austrians to the
beautiful city of Venice, then, and for long after, a part of
their dominions.</p>
<p>The shock was complete.&nbsp; I saw imaginary Italians upon
every side; and for the first, and, I may say, for the last time
in my experience, became overpowered by what is called a panic
terror.&nbsp; I knew nothing, that is, to be afraid of, and yet I
admit that I was heartily afraid; and it was with a sensible
reluctance that I returned to my exposed and solitary camp in the
Sea-Wood.</p>
<p>There I ate some cold porridge which had been left over from
the night before, for I was disinclined to make a fire; and,
feeling strengthened and reassured, dismissed all these fanciful
terrors from my mind, and lay down to sleep with composure.</p>
<p>How long I may have slept it is impossible for me to guess;
but I was awakened at last by a sudden, blinding flash of light
into my face.&nbsp; It woke me like a blow.&nbsp; In an instant I
was upon my knees.&nbsp; But the light had gone as suddenly as it
came.&nbsp; The darkness was intense.&nbsp; And, as it was
blowing great guns from the sea and pouring with rain, the noises
of the storm effectually concealed all others.</p>
<p>It was, I dare say, half a minute before I regained my
self-possession.&nbsp; But for two circumstances, I should have
thought I had been awakened by some new and vivid form of
nightmare.&nbsp; First, the flap of my tent, which I had shut
carefully when I retired, was now unfastened; and, second, I
could still perceive, with a sharpness that excluded any theory
of hallucination, the smell of hot metal and of burning
oil.&nbsp; The conclusion was obvious.&nbsp; I had been wakened
by some one flashing a bull&rsquo;s-eye lantern in my face.&nbsp;
It had been but a flash, and away.&nbsp; He had seen my face, and
then gone.&nbsp; I asked myself the object of so strange a
proceeding, and the answer came pat.&nbsp; The man, whoever he
was, had thought to recognise me, and he had not.&nbsp; There was
yet another question unresolved; and to this, I may say, I feared
to give an answer; if he had recognised me, what would he have
done?</p>
<p>My fears were immediately diverted from myself, for I saw that
I had been visited in a mistake; and I became persuaded that some
dreadful danger threatened the pavilion.&nbsp; It required some
nerve to issue forth into the black and intricate thicket which
surrounded and overhung the den; but I groped my way to the
links, drenched with rain, beaten upon and deafened by the gusts,
and fearing at every step to lay my hand upon some lurking
adversary.&nbsp; The darkness was so complete that I might have
been surrounded by an army and yet none the wiser, and the uproar
of the gale so loud that my hearing was as useless as my
sight.</p>
<p>For the rest of that night, which seemed interminably long, I
patrolled the vicinity of the pavilion, without seeing a living
creature or hearing any noise but the concert of the wind, the
sea, and the rain.&nbsp; A light in the upper story filtered
through a cranny of the shutter, and kept me company till the
approach of dawn.</p>

209</span>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS OF AN INTERVIEW BETWEEN NORTHMOUR,
CLARA, AND MYSELF</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">With</span> the first peep of day, I
retired from the open to my old lair among the sand-hills, there
to await the coming of my wife.&nbsp; The morning was grey, wild,
and melancholy; the wind moderated before sunrise, and then went
about, and blew in puffs from the shore; the sea began to go
down, but the rain still fell without mercy.&nbsp; Over all the
wilderness of links there was not a creature to be seen.&nbsp;
Yet I felt sure the neighbourhood was alive with skulking
foes.&nbsp; The light that had been so suddenly and surprisingly
flashed upon my face as I lay sleeping, and the hat that had been
blown ashore by the wind from over Graden Floe, were two speaking
signals of the peril that environed Clara and the party in the
pavilion.</p>
<p>It was, perhaps, half-past seven, or nearer eight, before I
saw the door open, and that dear figure come towards me in the
rain.&nbsp; I was waiting for her on the beach before she had
crossed the sand-hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have had such trouble to come!&rdquo; she
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They did not wish me to go walking in the
rain.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Clara,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;you are not
frightened!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said she, with a simplicity that filled my
heart with confidence.&nbsp; For my wife was the bravest as well
as the best of women; in my experience, I have not found the two
go always together, but with her they did; and she combined the
extreme of fortitude with the most endearing and beautiful
virtues.</p>
<p>I told her what had happened; and, though her cheek grew
visibly paler, she retained perfect control over her senses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see now that I am safe,&rdquo; said I, in
conclusion.&nbsp; &ldquo;They do not mean to harm me; for, had
they chosen, I was a dead man last night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She laid her hand upon my arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I had no presentiment!&rdquo; she cried.</p>
<p>Her accent thrilled me with delight.&nbsp; I put my arm about
her, and strained her to my side; and, before either of us was
aware, her hands were on my shoulders and my lips upon her
mouth.&nbsp; Yet up to that moment no word of love had passed
between us.&nbsp; To this day I remember the touch of her cheek,
which was wet and cold with the rain; and many a time since, when
she has been washing her face, I have kissed it again for the
sake of that morning on the beach.&nbsp; Now that she is taken
from me, and I finish my pilgrimage alone, I recall our old
lovingkindnesses and the deep honesty and affection which united
us, and my present loss seems but a trifle in comparison.</p>
<p>We may have thus stood for some seconds&mdash;for time passes
quickly with lovers&mdash;before we were startled by a peal of
laughter close at hand.&nbsp; It was not natural mirth, but
seemed to be affected in order to conceal an angrier
feeling.&nbsp; We both turned, though I still kept my left arm
about Clara&rsquo;s waist; nor did she seek to withdraw herself;
and there, a few paces off upon the beach, stood Northmour, his
head lowered, his hands behind his back, his nostrils white with
passion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah! Cassilis!&rdquo; he said, as I disclosed my
face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That same,&rdquo; said I; for I was not at all put
about.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so, Miss Huddlestone,&rdquo; he continued slowly
but savagely, &ldquo;this is how you keep your faith to your
father and to me?&nbsp; This is the value you set upon your
father&rsquo;s life?&nbsp; And you are so infatuated with this
young gentleman that you must brave ruin, and decency, and common
human caution&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Miss Huddlestone&mdash;&rdquo; I was beginning to
interrupt him, when he, in his turn, cut in brutally&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hold your tongue,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I am
speaking to that girl.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That girl, as you call her, is my wife,&rdquo; said I;
and my wife only leaned a little nearer, so that I knew she had
affirmed my words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your what?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
lie!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;we all know you have a
bad temper, and I am the last man to be irritated by words.&nbsp;
For all that, I propose that you speak lower, for I am convinced
that we are not alone.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked round him, and it was plain my remark had in some
degree sobered his passion.&nbsp; &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
he asked.</p>
<p>I only said one word: &ldquo;Italians.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He swore a round oath, and looked at us, from one to the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Cassilis knows all that I know,&rdquo; said my
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What I want to know,&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;is
where the devil Mr. Cassilis comes from, and what the devil Mr.
Cassilis is doing here.&nbsp; You say you are married; that I do
not believe.&nbsp; If you were, Graden Floe would soon divorce
you; four minutes and a half, Cassilis.&nbsp; I keep my private
cemetery for my friends.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It took somewhat longer,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;for that
Italian.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at me for a moment half daunted, and then, almost
civilly, asked me to tell my story.&nbsp; &ldquo;You have too
much the advantage of me, Cassilis,&rdquo; he added.&nbsp; I
complied of course; and he listened, with several ejaculations,
while I told him how I had come to Graden: that it was I whom he
had tried to murder on the night of landing; and what I had
subsequently seen and heard of the Italians.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, when I had done, &ldquo;it is
here at last; there is no mistake about that.&nbsp; And what, may
I ask, do you propose to do?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I propose to stay with you and lend a hand,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are a brave man,&rdquo; he returned, with a
peculiar intonation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not afraid,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;I am to understand
that you two are married?&nbsp; And you stand up to it before my
face, Miss Huddlestone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;We are not yet married,&rdquo; said Clara; &ldquo;but
we shall be as soon as we can.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bravo!&rdquo; cried Northmour.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the
bargain?&nbsp; D&mdash;n it, you&rsquo;re not a fool, young
woman; I may call a spade a spade with you.&nbsp; How about the
bargain?&nbsp; You know as well as I do what your father&rsquo;s
life depends upon.&nbsp; I have only to put my hands under my
coat-tails and walk away, and his throat would he cut before the
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Northmour,&rdquo; returned Clara, with great
spirit; &ldquo;but that is what you will never do.&nbsp; You made
a bargain that was unworthy of a gentleman; but you are a
gentleman for all that, and you will never desert a man whom you
have begun to help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;You think I will give
my yacht for nothing?&nbsp; You think I will risk my life and
liberty for love of the old gentleman; and then, I suppose, be
best man at the wedding, to wind up?&nbsp; Well,&rdquo; he added,
with an odd smile, &ldquo;perhaps you are not altogether
wrong.&nbsp; But ask Cassilis here.&nbsp; <i>He</i> knows
me.&nbsp; Am I a man to trust?&nbsp; Am I safe and
scrupulous?&nbsp; Am I kind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know you talk a great deal, and sometimes, I think,
very foolishly,&rdquo; replied Clara, &ldquo;but I know you are a
gentleman, and I am not the least afraid.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked at her with a peculiar approval and admiration;
then, turning to me, &ldquo;Do you think I would give her up
without a struggle, Frank?&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I tell
you plainly, you look out.&nbsp; The next time we come to
blows&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will make the third,&rdquo; I interrupted, smiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye, true; so it will,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
had forgotten.&nbsp; Well, the third time&rsquo;s
lucky.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The third time, you mean, you will have the crew of the
<i>Red Earl</i> to help,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear him?&rdquo; he asked, turning to my
wife.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hear two men speaking like cowards,&rdquo; said
she.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should despise myself either to think or
speak like that.&nbsp; And neither of you believe one word that
you are saying, which makes it the more wicked and
silly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a trump!&rdquo; cried Northmour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s not yet Mrs. Cassilis.&nbsp; I say no
more.&nbsp; The present is not for me.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then my wife
surprised me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I leave you here,&rdquo; she said suddenly.&nbsp;
&ldquo;My father has been too long alone.&nbsp; But remember
this: you are to be friends, for you are both good friends to
me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She has since told me her reason for this step.&nbsp; As long
as she remained, she declares that we two would have continued to
quarrel; and I suppose that she was right, for when she was gone
we fell at once into a sort of confidentiality.</p>
<p>Northmour stared after her as she went away over the
sand-hill</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is the only woman in the world!&rdquo; he exclaimed
with an oath.&nbsp; &ldquo;Look at her action.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I, for my part, leaped at this opportunity for a little
further light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See here, Northmour,&rdquo; said I; &ldquo;we are all
in a tight place, are we not?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe you, my boy,&rdquo; he answered, looking me
in the eyes, and with great emphasis.&nbsp; &ldquo;We have all
hell upon us, that&rsquo;s the truth.&nbsp; You may believe me or
not, but I&rsquo;m afraid of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are
they after, these Italians?&nbsp; What do they want with Mr.
Huddlestone?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you know?&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
black old scamp had<i> carbonaro</i> funds on a deposit&mdash;two
hundred and eighty thousand; and of course he gambled it away on
stocks.&nbsp; There was to have been a revolution in the
Tridentino, or Parma; but the revolution is off, and the whole
wasp&rsquo;s nest is after Huddlestone.&nbsp; We shall all be
lucky if we can save our skins.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>carbonari</i>!&rdquo; I exclaimed; &ldquo;God
help him indeed!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp; &ldquo;And now, look
here: I have said that we are in a fix; and, frankly, I shall be
glad of your help.&nbsp; If I can&rsquo;t save Huddlestone, I
want at least to save the girl.&nbsp; Come and stay in the
pavilion; and, there&rsquo;s my hand on it, I shall act as your
friend until the old man is either clear or dead.&nbsp;
But,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;once that is settled, you become my
rival once again, and I warn you&mdash;mind yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Done!&rdquo; said I; and we shook hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now let us go directly to the fort,&rdquo; said
Northmour; and he began to lead the way through the rain.</p>

215</span>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS OF MY INTRODUCTION TO THE TALL
MAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">We</span> were admitted to the pavilion by
Clara, and I was surprised by the completeness and security of
the defences.&nbsp; A barricade of great strength, and yet easy
to displace, supported the door against Any violence from
without; and the shutters of the dining-room, into which I was
led directly, and which was feebly illuminated by a lamp, were
even more elaborately fortified.&nbsp; The panels were
strengthened by bars and cross-bars; and these, in their turn,
were kept in position by a system of braces and struts, some
abutting on the floor, some on the roof, and others, in fine,
against the opposite wall of the apartment.&nbsp; It was at once
a solid and well-designed piece of carpentry; and I did not seek
to conceal my admiration.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the engineer,&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You remember the planks in the garden?&nbsp; Behold
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not know you had so many talents,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you armed?&rdquo; he continued, pointing to an
array of guns and pistols, all in admirable order, which stood in
line against the wall or were displayed upon the sideboard.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; I returned; &ldquo;I have gone armed
since our last encounter.&nbsp; But, to tell you the truth, I
have had nothing to eat since early yesterday evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northmour produced some cold meat, to which I eagerly set
myself, and a bottle of good Burgundy, by which, wet as I was, I
did not scruple to profit.&nbsp; I have always been an extreme
temperance man on principle; but it is useless to push principle
to excess, and on this occasion I believe that I finished
three-quarters of the bottle.&nbsp; As I ate, I still continued
to admire the preparations for defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We could stand a siege,&rdquo; I said at length.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ye-es,&rdquo; drawled Northmour; &ldquo;a very little
one, per-haps.&nbsp; It is not so much the strength of the
pavilion I misdoubt; it is the doubled anger that kills me.&nbsp;
If we get to shooting, wild as the country is some one is sure to
hear it, and then&mdash;why then it&rsquo;s the same thing, only
different, as they say: caged by law, or killed by
<i>carbonari</i>.&nbsp; There&rsquo;s the choice.&nbsp; It is a
devilish bad thing to have the law against you in this world, and
so I tell the old gentleman upstairs.&nbsp; He is quite of my way
of thinking.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Speaking of that,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;what kind of
person is he?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, he!&rdquo; cried the other; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s a
rancid fellow, as far as he goes.&nbsp; I should like to have his
neck wrung to-morrow by all the devils in Italy.&nbsp; I am not
in this affair for him.&nbsp; You take me?&nbsp; I made a bargain
for Missy&rsquo;s hand, and I mean to have it too.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That by the way,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
understand.&nbsp; But how will Mr. Huddlestone take my
intrusion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Leave that to Clara,&rdquo; returned Northmour.</p>
<p>I could have struck him in the face for this coarse
familiarity; but I respected the truce, as, I am bound to say,
did Northmour, and so long as the danger continued not a cloud
arose in our relation.&nbsp; I bear him this testimony with the
most unfeigned satisfaction; nor am I without pride when I look
back upon my own behaviour.&nbsp; For surely no two men were ever
left in a position so invidious and irritating.</p>
<p>As soon as I had done eating, we proceeded to inspect the
lower floor.&nbsp; Window by window we tried the different
supports, now and then making an inconsiderable change; and the
strokes of the hammer sounded with startling loudness through the
house.&nbsp; I proposed, I remember, to make loop-holes; but he
told me they were already made in the windows of the upper
story.&nbsp; It was an anxious business this inspection, and left
me down-hearted.&nbsp; There were two doors and five windows to
protect, and, counting Clara, only four of us to defend them
against an unknown number of foes.&nbsp; I communicated my doubts
to Northmour, who assured me, with unmoved composure, that he
entirely shared them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Before morning,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;we shall all be
butchered and buried in Graden Floe.&nbsp; For me, that is
written.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I could not help shuddering at the mention of the quicksand,
but reminded Northmour that our enemies had spared me in the
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not flatter yourself,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Then you were not in the same boat with the old gentleman;
now you are.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s the floe for all of us, mark my
words.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I trembled for Clara; and just then her dear voice was heard
calling us to come upstairs.&nbsp; Northmour showed me the way,
and, when he had reached the landing, knocked at the door of what
used to be called <i>My Uncle&rsquo;s Bedroom</i>, as the founder
of the pavilion had designed it especially for himself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, Northmour; come in, dear Mr. Cassilis,&rdquo;
said a voice from within.</p>
<p>Pushing open the door, Northmour admitted me before him into
the apartment.&nbsp; As I came in I could see the daughter
slipping out by the side door into the study, which had been
prepared as her bedroom.&nbsp; In the bed, which was drawn back
against the wall, instead of standing, as I had last seen it,
boldly across the window, sat Bernard Huddlestone, the defaulting
banker.&nbsp; Little as I had seen of him by the shifting light
of the lantern on the links, I had no difficulty in recognising
him for the same.&nbsp; He had a long and sallow countenance,
surrounded by a long red beard and side whiskers.&nbsp; His
broken nose and high cheekbones gave him somewhat the air of a
Kalmuck, and his light eyes shone with the excitement of a high
fever.&nbsp; He wore a skull-cap of black silk; a huge Bible lay
open before him on the bed, with a pair of gold spectacles in the
place, and a pile of other books lay on the stand by his
side.&nbsp; The green curtains lent a cadaverous shade to his
cheek; and, as he sat propped on pillows, his great stature was
painfully hunched, and his head protruded till it overhung his
knees.&nbsp; I believe if he had not died otherwise, he must have
fallen a victim to consumption in the course of but a very few
weeks.</p>
<p>He held out to me a hand, long, thin, and disagreeably
hairy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in, come in, Mr. Cassilis,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Another protector&mdash;ahem!&mdash;another
protector.&nbsp; Always welcome as a friend of my
daughter&rsquo;s, Mr. Cassilis.&nbsp; How they have rallied about
me, my daughter&rsquo;s friends!&nbsp; May God in heaven bless
and reward them for it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I gave him my hand, of course, because I could not help it;
but the sympathy I had been prepared to feel for Clara&rsquo;s
father was immediately soured by his appearance, and the
wheedling, unreal tones in which he spoke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cassilis is a good man,&rdquo; said Northmour;
&ldquo;worth ten.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So I hear,&rdquo; cried Mr. Huddlestone eagerly
&ldquo;so my girl tells me.&nbsp; Ah, Mr. Cassilis, my sin has
found me out, you see!&nbsp; I am very low, very low; but I hope
equally penitent.&nbsp; We must all come to the throne of grace
at last, Mr. Cassilis.&nbsp; For my part, I come late indeed; but
with unfeigned humility, I trust.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fiddle-de-dee!&rdquo; said Northmour roughly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no, dear Northmour!&rdquo; cried the banker.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You must not say that; you must not try to shake me.&nbsp;
You forget, my dear, good boy, you forget I may be called this
very night before my Maker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>His excitement was pitiful to behold; and I felt myself grow
indignant with Northmour, whose infidel opinions I well knew, and
heartily derided, as he continued to taunt the poor sinner out of
his humour of repentance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pooh, my dear Huddlestone!&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do yourself injustice.&nbsp; You are a man of the
world inside and out, and were up to all kinds of mischief before
I was born.&nbsp; Your conscience is tanned like South American
leather&mdash;only you forgot to tan your liver, and that, if you
will believe me, is the seat of the annoyance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Rogue, rogue! bad boy!&rdquo; said Mr. Huddlestone,
shaking his finger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am no precisian, if you come
to that; I always hated a precisian; but I never lost hold of
something better through it all.&nbsp; I have been a bad boy, Mr.
Cassilis; I do not seek to deny that; but it was after my
wife&rsquo;s death, and you know, with a widower, it&rsquo;s a
different thing: sinful&mdash;I won&rsquo;t say no; but there is
a gradation, we shall hope.&nbsp; And talking of
that&mdash;Hark!&rdquo; he broke out suddenly, his hand raised,
his fingers spread, his face racked with interest and
terror.&nbsp; &ldquo;Only the rain, bless God!&rdquo; he added,
after a pause, and with indescribable relief.</p>
<p>For some seconds he lay back among the pillows like a man near
to fainting; then he gathered himself together, and, in somewhat
tremulous tones, began once more to thank me for the share I was
prepared to take in his defence.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One question, sir,&rdquo; said I, when he had
paused.&nbsp; &ldquo;Is it true that you have money with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed annoyed by the question, but admitted with
reluctance that he had a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; I continued, &ldquo;it is their money they
are after, is it not?&nbsp; Why not give it up to
them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; replied he, shaking his head, &ldquo;I have
tried that already, Mr. Cassilis; and alas that it should be so!
but it is blood they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huddlestone, that&rsquo;s a little less than
fair,&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp; &ldquo;You should mention that
what you offered them was upwards of two hundred thousand
short.&nbsp; The deficit is worth a reference; it is for what
they call a cool sum, Frank.&nbsp; Then, you see, the fellows
reason in their clear Italian way; and it seems to them, as
indeed it seems to me, that they may just as well have both while
they&rsquo;re about it&mdash;money and blood together, by George,
and no more trouble for the extra pleasure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it in the pavilion?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is; and I wish it were in the bottom of the sea
instead,&rdquo; said Northmour; and then
suddenly&mdash;&ldquo;What are you making faces at me for?&rdquo;
he cried to Mr. Huddlestone, on whom I had unconsciously turned
my back.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think Cassilis would sell
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Huddlestone protested that nothing had been further from
his mind.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a good thing,&rdquo; retorted Northmour in his
ugliest manner.&nbsp; &ldquo;You might end by wearying us.&nbsp;
What were you going to say?&rdquo; he added, turning to me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to propose an occupation for the
afternoon,&rdquo; said I.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us carry that money
out, piece by piece, and lay it down before the pavilion
door.&nbsp; If the <i>carbonari</i> come, why, it&rsquo;s theirs
at any rate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, no,&rdquo; cried Mr. Huddlestone; &ldquo;it does
not, it cannot belong to them!&nbsp; It should be distributed
<i>pro rata</i> among all my creditors.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now, Huddlestone,&rdquo; said Northmour,
&ldquo;none of that.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, but my daughter,&rdquo; moaned the wretched
man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your daughter will do well enough.&nbsp; Here are two
suitors, Cassilis and I, neither of us beggars, between whom she
has to choose.&nbsp; And as for yourself, to make an end of
arguments, you have no right to a farthing, and, unless I&rsquo;m
much mistaken, you are going to die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It was certainly very cruelly said; but Mr. Huddlestone was a
man who attracted little sympathy; and, although I saw him wince
and shudder, I mentally endorsed the rebuke; nay, I added a
contribution of my own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour and I,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;are willing
enough to help you to save your life, but not to escape with
stolen property.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He struggled for a while with himself, as though he were on
the point of giving way to anger, but prudence had the best of
the controversy.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear boys,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do with me or my
money what you will.&nbsp; I leave all in your hands.&nbsp; Let
me compose myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And so we left him, gladly enough I am sure.&nbsp; The last
that I saw, he had once more taken up his great Bible, and with
tremulous hands was adjusting his spectacles to read.</p>

221</span>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS HOW A WORD WAS CRIED THROUGH THE
PAVILION WINDOW</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> recollection of that afternoon
will always be graven on my mind.&nbsp; Northmour and I were
persuaded that an attack was imminent; and if it had been in our
power to alter in any way the order of events, that power would
have been used to precipitate rather than delay the critical
moment.&nbsp; The worst was to be anticipated; yet we could
conceive no extremity so miserable as the suspense we were now
suffering.&nbsp; I have never been an eager, though always a
great, reader; but I never knew books so insipid as those which I
took up and cast aside that afternoon in the pavilion.&nbsp; Even
talk became impossible, as the hours went on.&nbsp; One or other
was always listening for some sound, or peering from an upstairs
window over the links.&nbsp; And yet not a sign indicated the
presence of our foes.</p>
<p>We debated over and over again my proposal with regard to the
money; and had we been in complete possession of our faculties, I
am sure we should have condemned it as unwise; but we were
flustered with alarm, grasped at a straw, and determined,
although it was as much as advertising Mr. Huddlestone&rsquo;s
presence in the pavilion, to carry my proposal into effect.</p>
<p>The sum was part in specie, part in bank paper, and part in
circular notes payable to the name of James Gregory.&nbsp; We
took it out, counted it, enclosed it once more in a despatch-box
belonging to Northmour, and prepared a letter in Italian which he
tied to the handle.&nbsp; It was signed by both of us under oath,
and declared that this was all the money which had escaped the
failure of the house of Huddlestone.&nbsp; This was, perhaps, the
maddest action ever perpetrated by two persons professing to be
sane.&nbsp; Had the despatch-box fallen into other hands than
those for which it was intended, we stood criminally convicted on
our own written testimony; but, as I have said, we were neither
of us in a condition to judge soberly, and had a thirst for
action that drove us to do something, right or wrong, rather than
endure the agony of waiting.&nbsp; Moreover, as we were both
convinced that the hollows of the links were alive with hidden
spies upon our movements, we hoped that our appearance with the
box might lead to a parley, and, perhaps, a compromise.</p>
<p>It was nearly three when we issued from the pavilion.&nbsp;
The rain had taken off; the sun shone quite cheerfully.</p>
<p>I have never seen the gulls fly so close about the house or
approach so fearlessly to human beings.&nbsp; On the very
doorstep one flapped heavily past our heads, and uttered its wild
cry in my very ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is an omen for you,&rdquo; said Northmour, who
like all freethinkers was much under the influence of
superstition.&nbsp; &ldquo;They think we are already
dead.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I made some light rejoinder, but it was with half my heart;
for the circumstance had impressed me.</p>
<p>A yard or two before the gate, on a patch of smooth turf, we
set down the despatch-box; and Northmour waved a white
handkerchief over his head.&nbsp; Nothing replied.&nbsp; We
raised our voices, and cried aloud in Italian that we were there
as ambassadors to arrange the quarrel; but the stillness remained
unbroken save by the sea-gulls and the surf.&nbsp; I had a weight
at my heart when we desisted; and I saw that even Northmour was
unusually pale.&nbsp; He looked over his shoulder nervously, as
though he feared that some one had crept between him and the
pavilion door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By God,&rdquo; he said in a whisper, &ldquo;this is too
much for me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>I replied in the same key: &ldquo;Suppose there should be
none, after all!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; he returned, nodding with his head,
as though he had been afraid to point.</p>
<p>I glanced in the direction indicated; and there, from the
northern quarter of the Sea-Wood, beheld a thin column of smoke
rising steadily against the now cloudless sky.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I said (we still continued to talk in
whispers), &ldquo;it is not possible to endure this
suspense.&nbsp; I prefer death fifty times over.&nbsp; Stay you
here to watch the pavilion; I will go forward and make sure, if I
have to walk right into their camp.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He looked once again all round him with puckered eyes, and
then nodded assentingly to my proposal.</p>
<p>My heart beat like a sledge-hammer as I set out walking
rapidly in the direction of the smoke; and, though up to that
moment I had felt chill and shivering, I was suddenly conscious
of a glow of heat over all my body.&nbsp; The ground in this
direction was very uneven; a hundred men might have lain hidden
in as many square yards about my path.&nbsp; But I had not
practised the business in vain, chose such routes as cut at the
very root of concealment, and, by keeping along the most
convenient ridges, commanded several hollows at a time.&nbsp; It
was not long before I was rewarded for my caution.&nbsp; Coming
suddenly on to a mound somewhat more elevated than the
surrounding hummocks, I saw, not thirty yards away, a man bent
almost double, and running as fast as his attitude permitted,
along the bottom of a gully.&nbsp; I had dislodged one of the
spies from his ambush.&nbsp; As soon as I sighted him, I called
loudly both in English and Italian; and he, seeing concealment
was no longer possible, straightened himself out, leaped from the
gully, and made off as straight as an arrow for the borders of
the wood.</p>
<p>It was none of my business to pursue; I had learned what I
wanted&mdash;that we were beleaguered and watched in the
pavilion; and I returned at once, and walking as nearly as
possible in my old footsteps, to where Northmour awaited me
beside the despatch-box.&nbsp; He was even paler than when I had
left him, and his voice shook a little.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Could you see what he was like?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He kept his back turned,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get into the house, Frank.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t
think I&rsquo;m a coward, but I can stand no more of this,&rdquo;
he whispered.</p>
<p>All was still and sunshiny about the pavilion as we turned to
re-enter it; even the gulls had flown in a wider circuit, and
were seen flickering along the beach and sand-hills; and this
loneliness terrified me more than a regiment under arms.&nbsp; It
was not until the door was barricaded that I could draw a full
inspiration and relieve the weight that lay upon my bosom.&nbsp;
Northmour and I exchanged a steady glance; and I suppose each
made his own reflections on the white and startled aspect of the
other.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You were right,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;All is
over.&nbsp; Shake hands, old man, for the last time.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied he, &ldquo;I will shake hands; for,
as sure as I am here, I bear no malice.&nbsp; But, remember, if,
by some impossible accident, we should give the slip to these
blackguards, I&rsquo;ll take the upper hand of you by fair or
foul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;you weary me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He seemed hurt, and walked away in silence to the foot of the
stairs, where he paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am not a swindler, and I guard myself; that is all.&nbsp; It may
weary you or not, Mr. Cassilis, I do not care a rush; I speak for
my own satisfaction, and not for your amusement.&nbsp; You had
better go upstairs and court the girl; for my part, I stay
here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I stay with you,&rdquo; I returned.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you think I would steal a march, even with your
permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frank,&rdquo; he said, smiling, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s a
pity you are an ass, for you have the makings of a man.&nbsp; I
think I must be <i>fey</i> to-day; you cannot irritate me even
when you try.&nbsp; Do you know,&rdquo; he continued softly,
&ldquo;I think we are the two most miserable men in England, you
and I? we have got on to thirty without wife or child, or so much
as a shop to look after&mdash;poor, pitiful, lost devils,
both!&nbsp; And now we clash about a girl!&nbsp; As if there were
not several millions in the United Kingdom!&nbsp; Ah, Frank,
Frank, the one who loses this throw, be it you or me, he has my
pity!&nbsp; It were better for him&mdash;how does the Bible
say?&mdash;that a millstone were hanged about his neck and he
were cast into the depth of the sea.&nbsp; Let us take a
drink,&rdquo; he concluded suddenly, but without any levity of
tone.</p>
<p>I was touched by his words, and consented.&nbsp; He sat down
on the table in the dining-room, and held up the glass of sherry
to his eye.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you beat me, Frank,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I shall
take to drink.&nbsp; What will you do, if it goes the other
way?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; I returned.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;here is a toast in the
meantime: &lsquo;<i>Italia irredenta</i>!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>
<p>The remainder of the day was passed in the same dreadful
tedium and suspense.&nbsp; I laid the table for dinner, while
Northmour and Clara prepared the meal together in the
kitchen.&nbsp; I could hear their talk as I went to and fro, and
was surprised to find it ran all the time upon myself.&nbsp;
Northmour again bracketed us together, and rallied Clara on a
choice of husbands; but he continued to speak of me with some
feeling, and uttered nothing to my prejudice unless he included
himself in the condemnation.&nbsp; This awakened a sense of
gratitude in my heart, which combined with the immediateness of
our peril to fill my eyes with tears.&nbsp; After all, I
thought&mdash;and perhaps the thought was laughably vain&mdash;we
were here three very noble human beings to perish in defence of a
thieving banker.</p>
<p>Before we sat down to table, I looked forth from an upstairs
window.&nbsp; The day was beginning to decline; the links were
utterly deserted; the despatch-box still lay untouched where we
had left it hours before.</p>
<p>Mr. Huddlestone, in a long yellow dressing-gown, took one end
of the table, Clara the other; while Northmour and I faced each
other from the sides.&nbsp; The lamp was brightly trimmed; the
wine was good; the viands, although mostly cold, excellent of
their sort.&nbsp; We seemed to have agreed tacitly; all reference
to the impending catastrophe was carefully avoided; and,
considering our tragic circumstances, we made a merrier party
than could have been expected.&nbsp; From time to time, it is
true, Northmour or I would rise from table and make a round of
the defences; and, on each of these occasions, Mr. Huddlestone
was recalled to a sense of his tragic predicament, glanced up
with ghastly eyes, and bore for an instant on his countenance the
stamp of terror.&nbsp; But he hastened to empty his glass, wiped
his forehead with his handkerchief, and joined again in the
conversation.</p>
<p>I was astonished at the wit and information he
displayed.&nbsp; Mr. Huddlestone&rsquo;s was certainly no
ordinary character; he had read and observed for himself; his
gifts were sound; and, though I could never have learned to love
the man, I began to understand his success in business, and the
great respect in which he had been held before his failure.&nbsp;
He had, above all, the talent of society; and though I never
heard him speak but on this one and most unfavourable occasion, I
set him down among the most brilliant conversationalists I ever
met.</p>
<p>He was relating with great gusto, and seemingly no feeling of
shame, the man&oelig;uvres of a scoundrelly commission merchant
whom he had known and studied in his youth, and we were all
listening with an odd mixture of mirth and embarrassment when our
little party was brought abruptly to an end in the most startling
manner.</p>
<p>A noise like that of a wet finger on the window-pane
interrupted Mr. Huddlestone&rsquo;s tale; and in an instant we
were all four as white as paper, and sat tongue-tied and
motionless round the table.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A snail,&rdquo; I said at last; for I had heard that
these animals make a noise somewhat similar in character.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Snail be d&mdash;d!&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hush!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The same sound was repeated twice at regular intervals; and
then a formidable voice shouted through the shutters the Italian
word &ldquo;<i>Traditore</i>!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mr. Huddlestone threw his head in the air; his eyelids
quivered; next moment he fell insensible below the table.&nbsp;
Northmour and I had each run to the armoury and seized a
gun.&nbsp; Clara was on her feet with her hand at her throat.</p>
<p>So we stood waiting, for we thought the hour of attack was
certainly come; but second passed after second, and all but the
surf remained silent in the neighbourhood of the pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Quick,&rdquo; said Northmour; &ldquo;upstairs with him
before they come.&rdquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page228"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
228</span>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="GutSmall">TELLS THE LAST OF THE TALL MAN</span></h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Somehow</span> or other, by hook and
crook, and between the three of us, we got Bernard Huddlestone
bundled upstairs and laid upon the bed in <i>My Uncle&rsquo;s
Room</i>.&nbsp; During the whole process, which was rough enough,
he gave no sign of consciousness, and he remained, as we had
thrown him, without changing the position of a finger.&nbsp; His
daughter opened his shirt and began to wet his head and bosom;
while Northmour and I ran to the window.&nbsp; The weather
continued clear; the moon, which was now about full, had risen
and shed a very clear light upon the links; yet, strain our eyes
as we might, we could distinguish nothing moving.&nbsp; A few
dark spots, more or less, on the uneven expanse were not to be
identified; they might be crouching men, they might be shadows;
it was impossible to be sure.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; said Northmour, &ldquo;Aggie is not
coming to-night.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Aggie was the name of the old nurse; he had not thought of her
till now; but that he should think of her at all, was a trait
that surprised me in the man.</p>
<p>We were again reduced to waiting.&nbsp; Northmour went to the
fireplace and spread his hands before the red embers, as if he
were cold.&nbsp; I followed him mechanically with my eyes, and in
so doing turned my back upon the window.&nbsp; At that moment a
very faint report was audible from without, and a ball shivered a
pane of glass, and buried itself in the shutter two inches from
my head.&nbsp; I heard Clara scream; and though I whipped
instantly out of range and into a corner, she was there, so to
speak, before me, beseeching to know if I were hurt.&nbsp; I felt
that I could stand to be shot at every day and all day long, with
such marks of solicitude for a reward; and I continued to
reassure her, with the tenderest caresses and in complete
forgetfulness of our situation, till the voice of Northmour
recalled me to myself.</p>
<p>&ldquo;An air-gun,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;They wish to
make no noise.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I put Clara aside, and looked at him.&nbsp; He was standing
with his back to the fire and his hands clasped behind him; and I
knew by the black look on his face, that passion was boiling
within.&nbsp; I had seen just such a look before he attacked me,
that March night, in the adjoining chamber; and, though I could
make every allowance for his anger, I confess I trembled for the
consequences.&nbsp; He gazed straight before him; but he could
see us with the tail of his eye, and his temper kept rising like
a gale of wind.&nbsp; With regular battle awaiting us outside,
this prospect of an internecine strife within the walls began to
daunt me.</p>
<p>Suddenly, as I was thus closely watching his expression and
prepared against the worst, I saw a change, a flash, a look of
relief, upon his face.&nbsp; He took up the lamp which stood
beside him on the table, and turned to us with an air of some
excitement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is one point that we must know,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they going to butcher the lot of us, or only
Huddlestone?&nbsp; Did they take you for him, or fire at you for
your own <i>beaux yeux</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;They took me for him, for certain,&rdquo; I
replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am near as tall, and my head is
fair.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am going to make sure,&rdquo; returned Northmour; and
he stepped up to the window, holding the lamp above his head, and
stood there, quietly affronting death, for half a minute.</p>
<p>Clara sought to rush forward and pull him from the place of
danger; but I had the pardonable selfishness to hold her back by
force.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Northmour, turning coolly from the
window; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s only Huddlestone they want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Northmour!&rdquo; cried Clara; but found no
more to add; the temerity she had just witnessed seeming beyond
the reach of words.</p>
<p>He, on his part, looked at me, cocking his head, with a fire
of triumph in his eyes; and I understood at once that he had thus
hazarded his life, merely to attract Clara&rsquo;s notice, and
depose me from my position as the hero of the hour.&nbsp; He
snapped his fingers.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The fire is only beginning,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;When they warm up to their work, they won&rsquo;t be so
particular.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A voice was now heard hailing us from the entrance.&nbsp; From
the window we could see the figure of a man in the moonlight; he
stood motionless, his face uplifted to ours, and a rag of
something white on his extended arm; and as we looked right down
upon him, though he was a good many yards distant on the links,
we could see the moonlight glitter on his eyes.</p>
<p>He opened his lips again, and spoke for some minutes on end,
in a key so loud that he might have been heard in every corner of
the pavilion, and as far away as the borders of the wood.&nbsp;
It was the same voice that had already shouted
&ldquo;<i>Traditore</i>!&rdquo; through the shutters of the
dining-room; this time it made a complete and clear
statement.&nbsp; If the traitor &ldquo;Oddlestone&rdquo; were
given up, all others should be spared; if not, no one should
escape to tell the tale.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, Huddlestone, what do you say to that?&rdquo;
asked Northmour, turning to the bed.</p>
<p>Up to that moment the banker had given no sign of life, and I,
at least, had supposed him to be still lying in a faint; but he
replied at once, and in such tones as I have never heard
elsewhere, save from a delirious patient, adjured and besought us
not to desert him.&nbsp; It was the most hideous and abject
performance that my imagination can conceive.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Enough,&rdquo; cried Northmour; and then he threw open
the window, leaned out into the night, and in a tone of
exultation, and with a total forgetfulness of what was due to the
presence of a lady, poured out upon the ambassador a string of
the most abominable raillery both in English and Italian, and
bade him be gone where he had come from.&nbsp; I believe that
nothing so delighted Northmour at that moment as the thought that
we must all infallibly perish before the night was out.</p>
<p>Meantime the Italian put his flag of truce into his pocket,
and disappeared, at a leisurely pace, among the sand-hills.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They make honourable war,&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp;
&ldquo;They are all gentlemen and soldiers.&nbsp; For the credit
of the thing, I wish we could change sides&mdash;you and I,
Frank, and you too, Missy, my darling&mdash;and leave that being
on the bed to some one else.&nbsp; Tut!&nbsp; Don&rsquo;t look
shocked!&nbsp; We are all going post to what they call eternity,
and may as well be above-board while there&rsquo;s time.&nbsp; As
far as I&rsquo;m concerned, if I could first strangle Huddlestone
and then get Clara in my arms, I could die with some pride and
satisfaction.&nbsp; And as it is, by God, I&rsquo;ll have a
kiss!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Before I could do anything to interfere, he had rudely
embraced and repeatedly kissed the resisting girl.&nbsp; Next
moment I had pulled him away with fury, and flung him heavily
against the wall.&nbsp; He laughed loud and long, and I feared
his wits had given way under the strain; for even in the best of
days he had been a sparing and a quiet laugher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Frank,&rdquo; said he, when his mirth was somewhat
appeased, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s your turn.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s my
hand.&nbsp; Good-bye; farewell!&rdquo;&nbsp; Then, seeing me
stand rigid and indignant, and holding Clara to my
side&mdash;&ldquo;Man!&rdquo; he broke out, &ldquo;are you
angry?&nbsp; Did you think we were going to die with all the airs
and graces of society?&nbsp; I took a kiss; I&rsquo;m glad I had
it; and now you can take another if you like, and square
accounts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I turned from him with a feeling of contempt which I did not
seek to dissemble.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As you please,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve been a prig in life; a prig you&rsquo;ll
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he sat down in a chair, a rifle over his knee,
and amused himself with snapping the lock; but I could see that
his ebullition of light spirits (the only one I ever knew him to
display) had already come to an end, and was succeeded by a
sullen, scowling humour.</p>
<p>All this time our assailants might have been entering the
house, and we been none the wiser; we had in truth almost
forgotten the danger that so imminently overhung our days.&nbsp;
But just then Mr. Huddlestone uttered a cry, and leaped from the
bed.</p>
<p>I asked him what was wrong.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fire!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;They have set the
house on fire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Northmour was on his feet in an instant, and he and I ran
through the door of communication with the study.&nbsp; The room
was illuminated by a red and angry light.&nbsp; Almost at the
moment of our entrance, a tower of flame arose in front of the
window, and, with a tingling report, a pane fell inwards on the
carpet.&nbsp; They had set fire to the lean-to outhouse, where
Northmour used to nurse his negatives.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hot work,&rdquo; said Northmour.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let us
try in your old room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We ran thither in a breath, threw up the casement, and looked
forth.&nbsp; Along the whole back wall of the pavilion piles of
fuel had been arranged and kindled; and it is probable they had
been drenched with mineral oil, for, in spite of the
morning&rsquo;s rain, they all burned bravely.&nbsp; The fire had
taken a firm hold already on the outhouse, which blazed higher
and higher every moment; the back door was in the centre of a
red-hot bonfire; the eaves we could see, as we looked upward,
were already smouldering, for the roof overhung, and was
supported by considerable beams of wood.&nbsp; At the same time,
hot, pungent, and choking volumes of smoke began to fill the
house.&nbsp; There was not a human being to be seen to right or
left.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, well!&rdquo; said Northmour, &ldquo;here&rsquo;s
the end, thank God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And we returned to <i>My Uncle&rsquo;s Room</i>.&nbsp; Mr.
Huddlestone was putting on his boots, still violently trembling,
but with an air of determination such as I had not hitherto
observed.&nbsp; Clara stood close by him, with her cloak in both
hands ready to throw about her shoulders, and a strange look in
her eyes, as if she were half hopeful, half doubtful of her
father.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, boys and girls,&rdquo; said Northmour, &ldquo;how
about a sally?&nbsp; The oven is heating; it is not good to stay
here and be baked; and, for my part, I want to come to my hands
with them, and be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is nothing else left,&rdquo; I replied.</p>
<p>And both Clara and Mr. Huddlestone, though with a very
different intonation, added, &ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As we went downstairs the heat was excessive, and the roaring
of the fire filled our ears; and we had scarce reached the
passage before the stairs window fell in, a branch of flame shot
brandishing through the aperture, and the interior of the
pavilion became lit up with that dreadful and fluctuating
glare.&nbsp; At the same moment we heard the fall of something
heavy and inelastic in the upper story.&nbsp; The whole pavilion,
it was plain, had gone alight like a box of matches, and now not
only flamed sky-high to land and sea, but threatened with every
moment to crumble and fall in about our ears.</p>
<p>Northmour and I cocked our revolvers.&nbsp; Mr. Huddlestone,
who had already refused a firearm, put us behind him with a
manner of command.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let Clara open the door,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp;
&ldquo;So, if they fire a volley, she will be protected.&nbsp;
And in the meantime stand behind me.&nbsp; I am the scapegoat; my
sins have found me out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I heard him, as I stood breathless by his shoulder, with my
pistol ready, pattering off prayers in a tremulous, rapid
whisper; and I confess, horrid as the thought may seem, I
despised him for thinking of supplications in a moment so
critical and thrilling.&nbsp; In the meantime, Clara, who was
dead white but still possessed her faculties, had displaced the
barricade from the front door.&nbsp; Another moment, and she had
pulled it open.&nbsp; Firelight and moonlight illuminated the
links with confused and changeful lustre, and far away against
the sky we could see a long trail of glowing smoke.</p>
<p>Mr. Huddlestone, filled for the moment with a strength greater
than his own, struck Northmour and myself a back-hander in the
chest; and while we were thus for the moment incapacitated from
action, lifting his arms above his head like one about to dive,
he ran straight forward out of the pavilion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here am!&rdquo; he
cried&mdash;&ldquo;Huddlestone!&nbsp; Kill me, and spare the
others!&rdquo;</p>
<p>His sudden appearance daunted, I suppose, our hidden enemies;
for Northmour and I had time to recover, to seize Clara between
us, one by each arm, and to rush forth to his assistance, ere
anything further had taken place.&nbsp; But scarce had we passed
the threshold when there came near a dozen reports and flashes
from every direction among the hollows of the links.&nbsp; Mr.
Huddlestone staggered, uttered a weird and freezing cry, threw up
his arms over his head, and fell backward on the turf.</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Traditore</i>!&nbsp; <i>Traditore</i>!&rdquo; cried
the invisible avengers.</p>
<p>And just then, a part of the roof of the pavilion fell in, so
rapid was the progress of the fire.&nbsp; A loud, vague, and
horrible noise accompanied the collapse, and a vast volume of
flame went soaring up to heaven.&nbsp; It must have been visible
at that moment from twenty miles out at sea, from the shore at
Graden Wester, and far inland from the peak of Graystiel, the
most eastern summit of the Caulder Hills.&nbsp; Bernard
Huddlestone, although God knows what were his obsequies, had a
fine pyre at the moment of his death.</p>

<span class="GutSmall">TELLS HOW NORTHMOUR CARRIED OUT HIS
THREAT</span></h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">should</span> have the greatest
difficulty to tell you what followed next after this tragic
circumstance.&nbsp; It is all to me, as I look back upon it,
mixed, strenuous, and ineffectual, like the struggles of a
sleeper in a nightmare.&nbsp; Clara, I remember, uttered a broken
sigh and would have fallen forward to earth, had not Northmour
and I supported her insensible body.&nbsp; I do not think we were
attacked; I do not remember even to have seen an assailant; and I
believe we deserted Mr. Huddlestone without a glance.&nbsp; I
only remember running like a man in a panic, now carrying Clara
altogether in my own arms, now sharing her weight with Northmour,
now scuffling confusedly for the possession of that dear
burden.&nbsp; Why we should have made for my camp in the Hemlock
Den, or how we reached it, are points lost for ever to my
recollection.&nbsp; The first moment at which I became definitely
sure, Clara had been suffered to fall against the outside of my
little tent, Northmour and I were tumbling together on the
ground, and he, with contained ferocity, was striking for my head
with the butt of his revolver.&nbsp; He had already twice wounded
me on the scalp; and it is to the consequent loss of blood that I
am tempted to attribute the sudden clearness of my mind.</p>
<p>I caught him by the wrist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I remember saying, &ldquo;you can
kill me afterwards.&nbsp; Let us first attend to
Clara.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He was at that moment uppermost.&nbsp; Scarcely had the words
passed my lips, when he had leaped to his feet and ran towards
the tent; and the next moment, he was straining Clara to his
heart and covering her unconscious hands and face with his
caresses.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shame!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Shame to you,
Northmour!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And, giddy though I still was, I struck him repeatedly upon
the head and shoulders.</p>
<p>He relinquished his grasp, and faced me in the broken
moonlight.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had you under, and I let you go,&rdquo; said he;
&ldquo;and now you strike me!&nbsp; Coward!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are the coward,&rdquo; I retorted.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
she wish your kisses while she was still sensible of what she
wanted?&nbsp; Not she!&nbsp; And now she may be dying; and you
waste this precious time, and abuse her helplessness.&nbsp; Stand
aside, and let me help her.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He confronted me for a moment, white and menacing; then
suddenly he stepped aside.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Help her then,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>I threw myself on my knees beside her, and loosened, as well
as I was able, her dress and corset; but while I was thus
engaged, a grasp descended on my shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep your hands of her,&rdquo; said Northmour
fiercely.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you think I have no blood in my
veins?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I cried, &ldquo;if you will neither
help her yourself, nor let me do so, do you know that I shall
have to kill you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is better!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;Let her
die also, where&rsquo;s the harm?&nbsp; Step aside from that
girl! and stand up to fight&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will observe,&rdquo; said I, half rising,
&ldquo;that I have not kissed her yet.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I dare you to,&rdquo; he cried.</p>
<p>I do not know what possessed me; it was one of the things I am
most ashamed of in my life, though, as my wife used to say, I
knew that my kisses would be always welcome were she dead or
living; down I fell again upon my knees, parted the hair from her
forehead, and, with the dearest respect, laid my lips for a
moment on that cold brow.&nbsp; It was such a caress as a father
might have given; it was such a one as was not unbecoming from a
man soon to die to a woman already dead.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And now,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I am at your service,
Mr. Northmour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>But I saw, to my surprise, that he had turned his back upon
me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; I asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I do.&nbsp; If you wish to
fight, I am ready.&nbsp; If not, go on and save Clara.&nbsp; All
is one to me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not wait to be twice bidden; but, stooping again over
Clara, continued my efforts to revive her.&nbsp; She still lay
white and lifeless; I began to fear that her sweet spirit had
indeed fled beyond recall, and horror and a sense of utter
desolation seized upon my heart.&nbsp; I called her by name with
the most endearing inflections; I chafed and beat her hands; now
I laid her head low, now supported it against my knee; but all
seemed to be in vain, and the lids still lay heavy on her
eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I said, &ldquo;there is my hat.&nbsp;
For God&rsquo;s sake bring some water from the spring.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Almost in a moment he was by my side with the water.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I have brought it in my own,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You do not grudge me the privilege?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Northmour,&rdquo; I was beginning to say, as I laved
her head and breast; but he interrupted me savagely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, you hush up!&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;The best
thing you can do is to say nothing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had certainly no desire to talk, my mind being swallowed up
in concern for my dear love and her condition; so I continued in
silence to do my best towards her recovery, and, when the hat was
empty, returned it to him, with one
word&mdash;&ldquo;More.&rdquo;&nbsp; He had, perhaps, gone
several times upon this errand, when Clara reopened her eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;since she is better, you
can spare me, can you not?&nbsp; I wish you a good night, Mr.
Cassilis.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he was gone among the thicket.&nbsp; I made a
fire, for I had now no fear of the Italians, who had even spared
all the little possessions left in my encampment; and, broken as
she was by the excitement and the hideous catastrophe of the
evening, I managed, in one way or another&mdash;by persuasion,
encouragement, warmth, and such simple remedies as I could lay my
hand on&mdash;to bring her back to some composure of mind and
strength of body.</p>
<p>Day had already come, when a sharp &ldquo;Hist!&rdquo; sounded
from the thicket.&nbsp; I started from the ground; but the voice
of Northmour was heard adding, in the most tranquil tones:
&ldquo;Come here, Cassilis, and alone; I want to show you
something.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I consulted Clara with my eyes, and, receiving her tacit
permission, left her alone, and clambered out of the den.&nbsp;
At some distance of I saw Northmour leaning against an elder;
and, as soon as he perceived me, he began walking seaward.&nbsp;
I had almost overtaken him as he reached the outskirts of the
wood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said he, pausing.</p>
<p>A couple of steps more brought me out of the foliage.&nbsp;
The light of the morning lay cold and clear over that well-known
scene.&nbsp; The pavilion was but a blackened wreck; the roof had
fallen in, one of the gables had fallen out; and, far and near,
the face of the links was cicatrised with little patches of burnt
furze.&nbsp; Thick smoke still went straight upwards in the
windless air of the morning, and a great pile of ardent cinders
filled the bare walls of the house, like coals in an open
grate.&nbsp; Close by the islet a schooner yacht lay to, and a
well-manned boat was pulling vigorously for the shore.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The <i>Red Earl</i>!&rdquo; I cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
<i>Red Earl</i> twelve hours too late!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Feel in your pocket, Frank.&nbsp; Are you armed?&rdquo;
asked Northmour.</p>
<p>I obeyed him, and I think I must have become deadly
pale.&nbsp; My revolver had been taken from me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see I have you in my power,&rdquo; he
continued.&nbsp; &ldquo;I disarmed you last night while you were
nursing Clara; but this morning&mdash;here&mdash;take your
pistol.&nbsp; No thanks!&rdquo; he cried, holding up his
hand.&nbsp; &ldquo;I do not like them; that is the only way you
can annoy me now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He began to walk forward across the links to meet the boat,
and I followed a step or two behind.&nbsp; In front of the
pavilion I paused to see where Mr. Huddlestone had fallen; but
there was no sign of him, nor so much as a trace of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Graden Floe,&rdquo; said Northmour.</p>
<p>He continued to advance till we had come to the head of the
beach.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No farther, please,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;Would
you like to take her to Graden House?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; replied I; &ldquo;I shall try to get
her to the minister&rsquo;s at Graden Wester.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The prow of the boat here grated on the beach, and a sailor
jumped ashore with a line in his hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait a minute, lads!&rdquo; cried Northmour; and then
lower and to my private ear: &ldquo;You had better say nothing of
all this to her,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>&ldquo;On the contrary!&rdquo; I broke out, &ldquo;she shall
know everything that I can tell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You do not understand,&rdquo; he returned, with an air
of great dignity.&nbsp; &ldquo;It will be nothing to her; she
expects it of me.&nbsp; Good-bye!&rdquo; he added, with a
nod.</p>
<p>I offered him my hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excuse me,&rdquo; said he.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
small, I know; but I can&rsquo;t push things quite so far as
that.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t wish any sentimental business, to sit
by your hearth a white-haired wanderer, and all that.&nbsp; Quite
the contrary: I hope to God I shall never again clap eyes on
either one of you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, God bless you, Northmour!&rdquo; I said
heartily.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; he returned.</p>
<p>He walked down the beach; and the man who was ashore gave him
an arm on board, and then shoved off and leaped into the bows
himself.&nbsp; Northmour took the tiller; the boat rose to the
waves, and the oars between the thole-pins sounded crisp and
measured in the morning air.</p>
<p>They were not yet half-way to the <i>Red Earl</i>, and I was
still watching their progress, when the sun rose out of the
sea.</p>
<p>One word more, and my story is done.&nbsp; Years after,
Northmour was killed fighting under the colours of Garibaldi for
the liberation of the Tyrol.</p>

LODGING FOR THE NIGHT<br />
<span class="GutSmall">A STORY OF FRANCIS VILLON</span></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in November 1456.&nbsp;
The snow fell over Paris with rigorous, relentless persistence;
sometimes the wind made a sally and scattered it in flying
vortices; sometimes there was a lull, and flake after flake
descended out of the black night air, silent, circuitous,
interminable.&nbsp; To poor people, looking up under moist
eyebrows, it seemed a wonder where it all came from.&nbsp; Master
Francis Villon had propounded an alternative that afternoon, at a
tavern window: was it only Pagan Jupiter plucking geese upon
Olympus? or were the holy angels moulting?&nbsp; He was only a
poor Master of Arts, he went on; and as the question somewhat
touched upon divinity, he durst not venture to conclude.&nbsp; A
silly old priest from Montargis, who was among the company,
treated the young rascal to a bottle of wine in honour of the
jest and the grimaces with which it was accompanied, and swore on
his own white beard that he had been just such another irreverent
dog when he was Villon&rsquo;s age.</p>
<p>The air was raw and pointed, but not far below freezing; and
the flakes were large, damp, and adhesive.&nbsp; The whole city
was sheeted up.&nbsp; An army might have marched from end to end
and not a footfall given the alarm.&nbsp; If there were any
belated birds in heaven, they saw the island like a large white
patch, and the bridges like slim white spars, on the black ground
of the river.&nbsp; High up overhead the snow settled among the
tracery of the cathedral towers.&nbsp; Many a niche was drifted
full; many a statue wore a long white bonnet on its grotesque or
sainted head.&nbsp; The gargoyles had been transformed into great
false noses, drooping towards the point.&nbsp; The crockets were
like upright pillows swollen on one side.&nbsp; In the intervals
of the wind, there was a dull sound of dripping about the
precincts of the church.</p>
<p>The cemetery of St. John had taken its own share of the
snow.&nbsp; All the graves were decently covered; tall white
housetops stood around in grave array; worthy burghers were long
ago in bed, benightcapped like their domiciles; there was no
light in all the neighbourhood but a little peep from a lamp that
hung swinging in the church choir, and tossed the shadows to and
fro in time to its oscillations.&nbsp; The clock was hard on ten
when the patrol went by with halberds and a lantern, beating
their hands; and they saw nothing suspicious about the cemetery
of St. John.</p>
<p>Yet there was a small house, backed up against the cemetery
wall, which was still awake, and awake to evil purpose, in that
snoring district.&nbsp; There was not much to betray it from
without; only a stream of warm vapour from the chimney-top, a
patch where the snow melted on the roof, and a few
half-obliterated footprints at the door.&nbsp; But within, behind
the shuttered windows, Master Francis Villon the poet, and some
of the thievish crew with whom he consorted, were keeping the
night alive and passing round the bottle.</p>
<p>A great pile of living embers diffused a strong and ruddy glow
from the arched chimney.&nbsp; Before this straddled Dom Nicolas,
the Picardy monk, with his skirts picked up and his fat legs
bared to the comfortable warmth.&nbsp; His dilated shadow cut the
room in half; and the firelight only escaped on either side of
his broad person, and in a little pool between his outspread
feet.&nbsp; His face had the beery, bruised appearance of the
continual drinker&rsquo;s; it was covered with a network of
congested veins, purple in ordinary circumstances, but now pale
violet, for even with his back to the fire the cold pinched him
on the other side.&nbsp; His cowl had half fallen back, and made
a strange excrescence on either side of his bull neck.&nbsp; So
he straddled, grumbling, and cut the room in half with the shadow
of his portly frame.</p>
<p>On the right, Villon and Guy Tabary were huddled together over
a scrap of parchment; Villon making a ballade which he was to
call the &ldquo;Ballade of Roast Fish,&rdquo; and Tabary
spluttering admiration at his shoulder.&nbsp; The poet was a rag
of a man, dark, little, and lean, with hollow cheeks and thin
black locks.&nbsp; He carried his four-and-twenty years with
feverish animation.&nbsp; Greed had made folds about his eyes,
evil smiles had puckered his mouth.&nbsp; The wolf and pig
struggled together in his face.&nbsp; It was an eloquent, sharp,
ugly, earthly countenance.&nbsp; His hands were small and
prehensile, with fingers knotted like a cord; and they were
continually flickering in front of him in violent and expressive
pantomime.&nbsp; As for Tabary, a broad, complacent, admiring
imbecility breathed from his squash nose and slobbering lips: he
had become a thief, just as he might have become the most decent
of burgesses, by the imperious chance that rules the lives of
human geese and human donkeys.</p>
<p>At the monk&rsquo;s other hand, Montigny and Thevenin Pensete
played a game of chance.&nbsp; About the first there clung some
flavour of good birth and training, as about a fallen angel;
something long, lithe, and courtly in the person; something
aquiline and darkling in the face.&nbsp; Thevenin, poor soul, was
in great feather: he had done a good stroke of knavery that
afternoon in the Faubourg St. Jacques, and all night he had been
gaining from Montigny.&nbsp; A flat smile illuminated his face;
his bald head shone rosily in a garland of red curls; his little
protuberant stomach shook with silent chucklings as he swept in
his gains.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubles or quits?&rdquo; said Thevenin.&nbsp; Montigny
nodded grimly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some may prefer to dine in state,&rdquo; wrote Villon,
&ldquo;On bread and cheese on silver plate.&nbsp;
Or&mdash;or&mdash;help me out, Guido!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tabary giggled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Or parsley on a golden dish,&rdquo; scribbled the
poet.</p>
<p>The wind was freshening without; it drove the snow before it,
and sometimes raised its voice in a victorious whoop, and made
sepulchral grumblings in the chimney.&nbsp; The cold was growing
sharper an the night went on.&nbsp; Villon, protruding his lips,
imitated the gust with something between a whistle and a
groan.&nbsp; It was an eerie, uncomfortable talent of the
poet&rsquo;s, much detested by the Picardy monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you hear it rattle in the gibbet?&rdquo;
said Villon.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are all dancing the devil&rsquo;s
jig on nothing, up there.&nbsp; You may dance, my gallants,
you&rsquo;ll be none the warmer!&nbsp; Whew! what a gust!&nbsp;
Down went somebody just now!&nbsp; A medlar the fewer on the
three-legged medlar-tree!&mdash;I say, Dom Nicolas, it&rsquo;ll
be cold to-night on the St. Denis Road?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>Dom Nicolas winked both his big eyes, and seemed to choke upon
his Adam&rsquo;s apple.&nbsp; Montfaucon, the great grisly Paris
gibbet, stood hard by the St. Denis Road, and the pleasantry
touched him on the raw.&nbsp; As for Tabary, he laughed
immoderately over the medlars; he had never heard anything more
light-hearted; and he held his sides and crowed.&nbsp; Villon
fetched him a fillip on the nose, which turned his mirth into an
attack of coughing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, stop that row,&rdquo; said Villon, &ldquo;and think
of rhymes to &lsquo;fish&rsquo;.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Doubles or quits,&rdquo; said Montigny doggedly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; quoth Thevenin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is there any more in that bottle?&rdquo; asked the
monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Open another,&rdquo; said Villon.&nbsp; &ldquo;How do
you ever hope to fill that big hogshead, your body, with little
things like bottles?&nbsp; And how do you expect to get to
heaven?&nbsp; How many angels, do you fancy, can be spared to
carry up a single monk from Picardy?&nbsp; Or do you think
yourself another Elias&mdash;and they&rsquo;ll send the coach for
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;<i>Hominibus impossibile</i>,&rdquo; replied the monk,
as he filled his glass.</p>
<p>Tabary was in ecstasies.</p>
<p>Villon filliped his nose again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Laugh at my jokes, if you like,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was very good,&rdquo; objected Tabary.</p>
<p>Villon made a face at him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Think of rhymes to
&lsquo;fish&rsquo;,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;What have you to
do with Latin?&nbsp; You&rsquo;ll wish you knew none of it at the
great assizes, when the devil calls for Guido Tabary,
clericus&mdash;the devil with the hump-back and red-hot
finger-nails.&nbsp; Talking of the devil,&rdquo; he added in a
whisper, &ldquo;look at Montigny!&rdquo;</p>
<p>All three peered covertly at the gamester.&nbsp; He did not
seem to be enjoying his luck.&nbsp; His mouth was a little to a
side; one nostril nearly shut, and the other much inflated.&nbsp;
The black dog was on his back, as people say, in terrifying
nursery metaphor; and he breathed hard under the gruesome
burden.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He looks as if he could knife him,&rdquo; whispered
Tabary, with round eyes.</p>
<p>The monk shuddered, and turned his face and spread his open
hands to the red embers.&nbsp; It was the cold that thus affected
Dom Nicolas, and not any excess of moral sensibility.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come now,&rdquo; said Villon&mdash;&ldquo;about this
ballade.&nbsp; How does it run so far?&rdquo;&nbsp; And beating
time with his hand, he read it aloud to Tabary.</p>
<p>They were interrupted at the fourth rhyme by a brief and fatal
movement among the gamesters.&nbsp; The round was completed, and
Thevenin was just opening his mouth to claim another victory,
when Montigny leaped up, swift as an adder, and stabbed him to
the heart.&nbsp; The blow took effect before he had time to utter
a cry, before he had time to move.&nbsp; A tremor or two
convulsed his frame; his hands opened and shut, his heels rattled
on the floor; then his head rolled backward over one shoulder
with the eyes wide open; and Thevenin Pensete&rsquo;s spirit had
returned to Him who made it.</p>
<p>Everyone sprang to his feet; but the business was over in two
twos.&nbsp; The four living fellows looked at each other in
rather a ghastly fashion; the dead man contemplating a corner of
the roof with a singular and ugly leer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My God!&rdquo; said Tabary; and he began to pray in
Latin.</p>
<p>Villon broke out into hysterical laughter.&nbsp; He came a
step forward and ducked a ridiculous bow at Thevenin, and laughed
still louder.&nbsp; Then he sat down suddenly, all of a heap,
upon a stool, and continued laughing bitterly as though he would
shake himself to pieces.</p>
<p>Montigny recovered his composure first.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s see what he has about him,&rdquo; he
remarked; and he picked the dead man&rsquo;s pockets with a
practised hand, and divided the money into four equal portions on
the table.&nbsp; &ldquo;There&rsquo;s for you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>
<p>The monk received his share with a deep sigh, and a single
stealthy glance at the dead Thevenin, who was beginning to sink
into himself and topple sideways of the chair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;re all in for it,&rdquo; cried Villon,
swallowing his mirth.&nbsp; &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a hanging job for
every man jack of us that&rsquo;s here&mdash;not to speak of
those who aren&rsquo;t.&rdquo;&nbsp; He made a shocking gesture
in the air with his raised right hand, and put out his tongue and
threw his head on one side, so as to counterfeit the appearance
of one who has been hanged.&nbsp; Then he pocketed his share of
the spoil, and executed a shuffle with his feet as if to restore
the circulation.</p>
<p>Tabary was the last to help himself; he made a dash at the
money, and retired to the other end of the apartment.</p>
<p>Montigny stuck Thevenin upright in the chair, and drew out the
dagger, which was followed by a jet of blood.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You fellows had better be moving,&rdquo; he said, as he
wiped the blade on his victim&rsquo;s doublet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I think we had,&rdquo; returned Villon with a
gulp.&nbsp; &ldquo;Damn his fat head!&rdquo; he broke out.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It sticks in my throat like phlegm.&nbsp; What right has a
man to have red hair when he is dead?&rdquo;&nbsp; And he fell
all of a heap again upon the stool, and fairly covered his face
with his hands.</p>
<p>Montigny and Dom Nicolas laughed aloud, even Tabary feebly
chiming in.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Cry baby,&rdquo; said the monk.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I always said he was a woman,&rdquo; added Montigny
with a sneer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Sit up, can&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; he
went on, giving another shake to the murdered body.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Tread out that fire, Nick!&rdquo;</p>
<p>But Nick was better employed; he was quietly taking
Villon&rsquo;s purse, as the poet sat, limp and trembling, on the
stool where he had been making a ballade not three minutes
before.&nbsp; Montigny and Tabary dumbly demanded a share of the
booty, which the monk silently promised as he passed the little
bag into the bosom of his gown.&nbsp; In many ways an artistic
nature unfits a man for practical existence.</p>
<p>No sooner had the theft been accomplished than Villon shook
himself, jumped to his feet, and began helping to scatter and
extinguish the embers.&nbsp; Meanwhile Montigny opened the door
and cautiously peered into the street.&nbsp; The coast was clear;
there was no meddlesome patrol in sight.&nbsp; Still it was
judged wiser to slip out severally; and as Villon was himself in
a hurry to escape from the neighbourhood of the dead Thevenin,
and the rest were in a still greater hurry to get rid of him
before he should discover the loss of his money, he was the first
by general consent to issue forth into the street.</p>
<p>The wind had triumphed and swept all the clouds from
heaven.&nbsp; Only a few vapours, as thin as moonlight, fleeting
rapidly across the stars.&nbsp; It was bitter cold; and by a
common optical effect, things seemed almost more definite than in
the broadest daylight.&nbsp; The sleeping city was absolutely
still: a company of white hoods, a field full of little Alps,
below the twinkling stars.&nbsp; Villon cursed his fortune.&nbsp;
Would it were still snowing!&nbsp; Now, wherever he went, he left
an indelible trail behind him on the glittering streets; wherever
he went he was still tethered to the house by the cemetery of St.
John; wherever he went he must weave, with his own plodding feet,
the rope that bound him to the crime and would bind him to the
gallows.&nbsp; The leer of the dead man came back to him with a
new significance.&nbsp; He snapped his fingers as if to pluck up
his own spirits, and choosing a street at random, stepped boldly
forward in the snow.</p>
<p>Two things preoccupied him as he went: the aspect of the
gallows at Montfaucon in this bright windy phase of the
night&rsquo;s existence, for one; and for another, the look of
the dead man with his bald head and garland of red curls.&nbsp;
Both struck cold upon his heart, and he kept quickening his pace
as if he could escape from unpleasant thoughts by mere fleetness
of foot.&nbsp; Sometimes he looked back over his shoulder with a
sudden nervous jerk; but he was the only moving thing in the
white streets, except when the wind swooped round a corner and
threw up the snow, which was beginning to freeze, in spouts of
glittering dust.</p>
<p>Suddenly he saw, a long way before him, a black clump and a
couple of lanterns.&nbsp; The clump was in motion, and the
lanterns swung as though carried by men walking.&nbsp; It was a
patrol.&nbsp; And though it was merely crossing his line of
march, he judged it wiser to get out of eyeshot as speedily as he
could.&nbsp; He was not in the humour to be challenged, and he
was conscious of making a very conspicuous mark upon the
snow.&nbsp; Just on his left hand there stood a great hotel, with
some turrets and a large porch before the door; it was
half-ruinous, he remembered, and had long stood empty; and so he
made three steps of it and jumped into the shelter of the
porch.&nbsp; It was pretty dark inside, after the glimmer of the
snowy streets, and he was groping forward with outspread hands,
when he stumbled over some substance which offered an
indescribable mixture of resistances, hard and soft, firm and
loose.&nbsp; His heart gave a leap, and he sprang two steps back
and stared dreadfully at the obstacle.&nbsp; Then he gave a
little laugh of relief.&nbsp; It was only a woman, and she
dead.&nbsp; He knelt beside her to make sure upon this latter
point.&nbsp; She was freezing cold, and rigid like a stick.&nbsp;
A little ragged finery fluttered in the wind about her hair, and
her cheeks had been heavily rouged that same afternoon.&nbsp; Her
pockets were quite empty; but in her stocking, underneath the
garter, Villon found two of the small coins that went by the name
of whites.&nbsp; It was little enough; but it was always
something; and the poet was moved with a deep sense of pathos
that she should have died before she had spent her money.&nbsp;
That seemed to him a dark and pitiable mystery; and he looked
from the coins in his hand to the dead woman, and back again to
the coins, shaking his head over the riddle of man&rsquo;s
life.&nbsp; Henry V. of England, dying at Vincennes just after he
had conquered France, and this poor jade cut off by a cold
draught in a great man&rsquo;s doorway, before she had time to
spend her couple of whites&mdash;it seemed a cruel way to carry
on the world.&nbsp; Two whites would have taken such a little
while to squander; and yet it would have been one more good taste
in the mouth, one more smack of the lips, before the devil got
the soul, and the body was left to birds and vermin.&nbsp; He
would like to use all his tallow before the light was blown out
and the lantern broken.</p>
<p>While these thoughts were passing through his mind, he was
feeling, half mechanically, for his purse.&nbsp; Suddenly his
heart stopped beating; a feeling of cold scales passed up the
back of his legs, and a cold blow seemed to fall upon his
scalp.&nbsp; He stood petrified for a moment; then he felt again
with one feverish movement; and then his loss burst upon him, and
he was covered at once with perspiration.&nbsp; To spendthrifts
money is so living and actual&mdash;it is such a thin veil
between them and their pleasures!&nbsp; There is only one limit
to their fortune&mdash;that of time; and a spendthrift with only
a few crowns is the Emperor of Rome until they are spent.&nbsp;
For such a person to lose his money is to suffer the most
shocking reverse, and fall from heaven to hell, from all to
nothing, in a breath.&nbsp; And all the more if he has put his
head in the halter for it; if he may be hanged to-morrow for that
same purse, so dearly earned, so foolishly departed!&nbsp; Villon
stood and cursed; he threw the two whites into the street; he
shook his fist at heaven; he stamped, and was not horrified to
find himself trampling the poor corpse.&nbsp; Then he began
rapidly to retrace his steps towards the house beside the
cemetery.&nbsp; He had forgotten all fear of the patrol, which
was long gone by at any rate, and had no idea but that of his
lost purse.&nbsp; It was in vain that he looked right and left
upon the snow: nothing was to be seen.&nbsp; He had not dropped
it in the streets.&nbsp; Had it fallen in the house?&nbsp; He
would have liked dearly to go in and see; but the idea of the
grisly occupant unmanned him.&nbsp; And he saw besides, as he
drew near, that their efforts to put out the fire had been
unsuccessful; on the contrary, it had broken into a blaze, and a
changeful light played in the chinks of door and window, and
revived his terror for the authorities and Paris gibbet.</p>
<p>He returned to the hotel with the porch, and groped about upon
the snow for the money he had thrown away in his childish
passion.&nbsp; But he could only find one white; the other had
probably struck sideways and sunk deeply in.&nbsp; With a single
white in his pocket, all his projects for a rousing night in some
wild tavern vanished utterly away.&nbsp; And it was not only
pleasure that fled laughing from his grasp; positive discomfort,
positive pain, attacked him as he stood ruefully before the
porch.&nbsp; His perspiration had dried upon him; and though the
wind had now fallen, a binding frost was setting in stronger with
every hour, and be felt benumbed and sick at heart.&nbsp; What
was to be done?&nbsp; Late as was the hour, improbable as was
success, he would try the house of his adopted father, the
chaplain of St. Beno&icirc;t.</p>
<p>He ran there all the way, and knocked timidly.&nbsp; There was
no answer.&nbsp; He knocked again and again, taking heart with
every stroke; and at last steps were heard approaching from
within.&nbsp; A barred wicket fell open in the iron-studded door,
and emitted a gush of yellow light.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold up your face to the wicket,&rdquo; said the
chaplain from within.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only me,&rdquo; whimpered Villon.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s only you, is it?&rdquo; returned the
chaplain; and he cursed him with foul unpriestly oaths for
disturbing him at such an hour, and bade him be off to hell,
where he came from.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My hands are blue to the wrist,&rdquo; pleaded Villon;
&ldquo;my feet are dead and full of twinges; my nose aches with
the sharp air; the cold lies at my heart.&nbsp; I may be dead
before morning.&nbsp; Only this once, father, and before God I
will never ask again!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should have come earlier,&rdquo; said the
ecclesiastic coolly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Young men require a lesson now
and then.&rdquo;&nbsp; He shut the wicket and retired
deliberately into the interior of the house.</p>
<p>Villon was beside himself; he beat upon the door with his
hands and feet, and shouted hoarsely after the chaplain.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wormy old fox!&rdquo; he cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I had
my hand under your twist, I would send you flying headlong into
the bottomless pit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A door shut in the interior, faintly audible to the poet down
long passages.&nbsp; He passed his hand over his mouth with an
oath.&nbsp; And then the humour of the situation struck him, and
he laughed and looked lightly up to heaven, where the stars
seemed to be winking over his discomfiture.</p>
<p>What was to be done?&nbsp; It looked very like a night in the
frosty streets.&nbsp; The idea of the dead woman popped into his
imagination, and gave him a hearty fright; what had happened to
her in the early night might very well happen to him before
morning.&nbsp; And he so young! and with such immense
possibilities of disorderly amusement before him!&nbsp; He felt
quite pathetic over the notion of his own fate, as if it had been
some one else&rsquo;s, and made a little imaginative vignette of
the scene in the morning when they should find his body.</p>
<p>He passed all his chances under review, turning the white
between his thumb and forefinger.&nbsp; Unfortunately he was on
bad terms with some old friends who would once have taken pity on
him in such a plight.&nbsp; He had lampooned them in verses, he
had beaten and cheated them; and yet now, when he was in so close
a pinch, he thought there was at least one who might perhaps
relent.&nbsp; It was a chance.&nbsp; It was worth trying at
least, and he would go and see.</p>
<p>On the way, two little accidents happened to him which
coloured his musings in a very different manner.&nbsp; For,
first, he fell in with the track of a patrol, and walked in it
for some hundred yards, although it lay out of his
direction.&nbsp; And this spirited him up; at least he had
confused his trail; for he was still possessed with the idea of
people tracking him all about Paris over the snow, and collaring
him next morning before he was awake.&nbsp; The other matter
affected him very differently.&nbsp; He passed a street corner,
where, not so long before, a woman and her child had been
devoured by wolves.&nbsp; This was just the kind of weather, he
reflected, when wolves might take it into their heads to enter
Paris again; and a lone man in these deserted streets would run
the chance of something worse than a mere scare.&nbsp; He stopped
and looked upon the place with an unpleasant interest&mdash;it
was a centre where several lanes intersected each other; and he
looked down them all one after another, and held his breath to
listen, lest he should detect some galloping black things on the
snow or hear the sound of howling between him and the
river.&nbsp; He remembered his mother telling him the story and
pointing out the spot, while he was yet a child.&nbsp; His
mother!&nbsp; If he only knew where she lived, he might make sure
at least of shelter.&nbsp; He determined he would inquire upon
the morrow; nay, he would go and see her too, poor old
girl!&nbsp; So thinking, he arrived at his destination&mdash;his
last hope for the night.</p>
<p>The house was quite dark, like its neighbours; and yet after a
few taps, he heard a movement overhead, a door opening, and a
cautious voice asking who was there.&nbsp; The poet named himself
in a loud whisper, and waited, not without come trepidation, the
result.&nbsp; Nor had he to wait long.&nbsp; A window was
suddenly opened, and a pailful of slops splashed down upon the
doorstep.&nbsp; Villon had not been unprepared for something of
the sort, and had put himself as much in shelter as the nature of
the porch admitted; but for all that, he was deplorably drenched
below the waist.&nbsp; His hose began to freeze almost at
once.&nbsp; Death from cold and exposure stared him in the face;
he remembered he was of phthisical tendency, and began coughing
tentatively.&nbsp; But the gravity of the danger steadied his
nerves.&nbsp; He stopped a few hundred yards from the door where
he had been so rudely used, and reflected with his finger to his
nose.&nbsp; He could only see one way of getting a lodging, and
that was to take it.&nbsp; He had noticed a house not far away,
which looked as if it might be easily broken into, and thither he
betook himself promptly, entertaining himself on the way with the
idea of a room still hot, with a table still loaded with the
remains of supper, where he might pass the rest of the black
hours, and whence he should issue, on the morrow, with an armful
of valuable plate.&nbsp; He even considered on what viands and
what wines he should prefer; and as he was calling the roll of
his favourite dainties, roast fish presented itself to his mind
with an odd mixture of amusement and horror.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I shall never finish that ballade,&rdquo; he thought to
himself; and then, with another shudder at the recollection,
&ldquo;Oh, damn his fat head!&rdquo; he repeated fervently, and
spat upon the snow.</p>
<p>The house in question looked dark at first sight; but as
Villon made a preliminary inspection in search of the handiest
point of attack, a little twinkle of light caught his eye from
behind a curtained window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The devil!&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp; &ldquo;People
awake!&nbsp; Some student or some saint, confound the crew!&nbsp;
Can&rsquo;t they get drunk and lie in bed snoring like their
neighbours?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the good of curfew, and poor
devils of bell-ringers jumping at a rope&rsquo;s end in
bell-towers?&nbsp; What&rsquo;s the use of day, if people sit up
all night?&nbsp; The gripes to them!&rdquo;&nbsp; He grinned as
he saw where his logic was leading him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Every man to
his business, after all,&rdquo; added he, &ldquo;and if
they&rsquo;re awake, by the Lord, I may come by a supper honestly
for this once, and cheat the devil.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He went boldly to the door and knocked with an assured
hand.&nbsp; On both previous occasions, he had knocked timidly
and with some dread of attracting notice; but now when he had
just discarded the thought of a burglarious entry, knocking at a
door seemed a mighty simple and innocent proceeding.&nbsp; The
sound of his blows echoed through the house with thin, phantasmal
reverberations, as though it were quite empty; but these had
scarcely died away before a measured tread drew near, a couple of
bolts were withdrawn, and one wing was opened broadly, as though
no guile or fear of guile were known to those within.&nbsp; A
tall figure of a man, muscular and spare, but a little bent,
confronted Villon.&nbsp; The head was massive in bulk, but finely
sculptured; the nose blunt at the bottom, but refining upward to
where it joined a pair of strong and honest eyebrows; the mouth
and eyes surrounded with delicate markings, and the whole face
based upon a thick white beard, boldly and squarely
trimmed.&nbsp; Seen as it was by the light of a flickering
hand-lamp, it looked perhaps nobler than it had a right to do;
but it was a fine face, honourable rather than intelligent,
strong, simple, and righteous.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You knock late, sir,&rdquo; said the old man in
resonant, courteous tones.</p>
<p>Villon cringed, and brought up many servile words of apology;
at a crisis of this sort, the beggar was uppermost in him, and
the man of genius hid his head with confusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are cold,&rdquo; repeated the old man, &ldquo;and
hungry?&nbsp; Well, step in.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he ordered him into
the house with a noble enough gesture.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Some great seigneur,&rdquo; thought Villon, as his
host, setting down the lamp on the flagged pavement of the entry,
shot the bolts once more into their places.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will pardon me if I go in front,&rdquo; he said,
when this was done; and he preceded the poet upstairs into a
large apartment, warmed with a pan of charcoal and lit by a great
lamp hanging from the roof.&nbsp; It was very bare of furniture:
only some gold plate on a sideboard; some folios; and a stand of
armour between the windows.&nbsp; Some smart tapestry hung upon
the walls, representing the crucifixion of our Lord in one piece,
and in another a scene of shepherds and shepherdesses by a
running stream.&nbsp; Over the chimney was a shield of arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Will you seat yourself,&rdquo; said the old man,
&ldquo;and forgive me if I leave you?&nbsp; I am alone in my
house to-night, and if you are to eat I must forage for you
myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>No sooner was his host gone than Villon leaped from the chair
on which he had just seated himself, and began examining the
room, with the stealth and passion of a cat.&nbsp; He weighed the
gold flagons in his hand, opened all the folios, and investigated
the arms upon the shield, and the stuff with which the seats were
lined.&nbsp; He raised the window curtains, and saw that the
windows were set with rich stained glass in figures, so far as he
could see, of martial import.&nbsp; Then he stood in the middle
of the room, drew a long breath, and retaining it with puffed
cheeks, looked round and round him, turning on his heels, as if
to impress every feature of the apartment on his memory.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Seven pieces of plate,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;If
there had been ten, I would have risked it.&nbsp; A fine house,
and a fine old master, so help me all the saints!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then, hearing the old man&rsquo;s tread returning
along the corridor, he stole back to his chair, and began humbly
toasting his wet legs before the charcoal pan.</p>
<p>His entertainer had a plate of meat in one hand and a jug of
wine in the other.&nbsp; He set down the plate upon the table,
motioning Villon to draw in his chair, and going to the
sideboard, brought back two goblets, which he filled.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I drink to your better fortune,&rdquo; he said, gravely
touching Villon&rsquo;s cup with his own.</p>
<p>&ldquo;To our better acquaintance,&rdquo; said the poet,
growing bold.&nbsp; A mere man of the people would have been awed
by the courtesy of the old seigneur, but Villon was hardened in
that matter; he had made mirth for great lords before now, and
found them as black rascals as himself.&nbsp; And so he devoted
himself to the viands with a ravenous gusto, while the old man,
leaning backward, watched him with steady, curious eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have blood on your shoulder, my man,&rdquo; he
said.&nbsp; Montigny must have laid his wet right hand upon him
as he left the house.&nbsp; He cursed Montigny in his heart.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It was none of my shedding,&rdquo; he stammered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I had not supposed so,&rdquo; returned his host
quietly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A brawl?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, something of that sort,&rdquo; Villon admitted
with a quaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps a fellow murdered?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, not murdered,&rdquo; said the poet, more and
more confused.&nbsp; &ldquo;It was all fair play&mdash;murdered
by accident.&nbsp; I had no hand in it, God strike me
dead!&rdquo; he added fervently.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One rogue the fewer, I dare say,&rdquo; observed the
master of the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may dare to say that,&rdquo; agreed Villon,
infinitely relieved.&nbsp; &ldquo;As big a rogue as there is
between here and Jerusalem.&nbsp; He turned up his toes like a
lamb.&nbsp; But it was a nasty thing to look at.&nbsp; I dare say
you&rsquo;ve seen dead men in your time, my lord?&rdquo; he
added, glancing at the armour.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Many,&rdquo; said the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have
followed the wars, as you imagine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villon laid down his knife and fork, which he had just taken
up again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Were any of them bald?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, and with hair as white as mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I should mind the white so
much,&rdquo; said Villon.&nbsp; &ldquo;His was red.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he had a return of his shuddering and tendency to laughter,
which he drowned with a great draught of wine.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a little put out when I think of it,&rdquo; he
went on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I knew him&mdash;damn him!&nbsp; And then
the cold gives a man fancies&mdash;or the fancies give a man
cold, I don&rsquo;t know which.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any money?&rdquo; asked the old man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have one white,&rdquo; returned the poet,
laughing.&nbsp; &ldquo;I got it out of a dead jade&rsquo;s
stocking in a porch.&nbsp; She was as dead as C&aelig;sar, poor
wench, and as cold as a church, with bits of ribbon sticking in
her hair.&nbsp; This is a hard world in winter for wolves and
wenches and poor rogues like me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I,&rdquo; said the old man, &ldquo;am Enguerrand de la
Feuill&eacute;e, seigneur de Brisetout, bailly du Patatrac.&nbsp;
Who and what may you be?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villon rose and made a suitable reverence.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
called Francis Villon,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;a poor Master of
Arts of this university.&nbsp; I know some Latin, and a deal of
vice.&nbsp; I can make chansons, ballades, lais, virelais, and
roundels, and I am very fond of wine.&nbsp; I was born in a
garret, and I shall not improbably die upon the gallows.&nbsp; I
may add, my lord, that from this night forward I am your
lordship&rsquo;s very obsequious servant to command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No servant of mine,&rdquo; said the knight; &ldquo;my
guest for this evening, and no more.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very grateful guest,&rdquo; said Villon politely; and
he drank in dumb show to his entertainer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are shrewd,&rdquo; began the old man, tapping his
forehead, &ldquo;very shrewd; you have learning; you are a clerk;
and yet you take a small piece of money off a dead woman in the
street.&nbsp; Is it not a kind of theft?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a kind of theft much practised in the wars, my
lord.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The wars are the field of honour,&rdquo; returned the
old man proudly.&nbsp; &ldquo;There a man plays his life upon the
cast; he fights in the name of his lord the king, his Lord God,
and all their lordships the holy saints and angels.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put it,&rdquo; said Villon, &ldquo;that I were really a
thief, should I not play my life also, and against heavier
odds?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;For gain, but not for honour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gain?&rdquo; repeated Villon with a shrug.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Gain!&nbsp; The poor fellow wants supper, and takes
it.&nbsp; So does the soldier in a campaign.&nbsp; Why, what are
all these requisitions we hear so much about?&nbsp; If they are
not gain to those who take them, they are loss enough to the
others.&nbsp; The men-at-arms drink by a good fire, while the
burgher bites his nails to buy them wine and wood.&nbsp; I have
seen a good many ploughmen swinging on trees about the country,
ay, I have seen thirty on one elm, and a very poor figure they
made; and when I asked some one how all these came to be hanged,
I was told it was because they could not scrape together enough
crowns to satisfy the men-at-arms.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;These things are a necessity of war, which the low-born
must endure with constancy.&nbsp; It is true that some captains
drive over hard; there are spirits in every rank not easily moved
by pity; and indeed many follow arms who are no better than
brigands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; said the poet, &ldquo;you cannot
separate the soldier from the brigand; and what is a thief but an
isolated brigand with circumspect manners?&nbsp; I steal a couple
of mutton chops, without so much as disturbing people&rsquo;s
sleep; the farmer grumbles a bit, but sups none the less
wholesomely on what remains.&nbsp; You come up blowing gloriously
on a trumpet, take away the whole sheep, and beat the farmer
pitifully into the bargain.&nbsp; I have no trumpet; I am only
Tom, Dick, or Harry; I am a rogue and a dog, and hanging&rsquo;s
too good for me&mdash;with all my heart; but just you ask the
farmer which of us he prefers, just find out which of us he lies
awake to curse on cold nights.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Look at us two,&rdquo; said his lordship.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am old, strong, and honoured.&nbsp; If I were turned
from my house to-morrow, hundreds would be proud to shelter
me.&nbsp; Poor people would go out and pass the night in the
streets with their children, if I merely hinted that I wished to
be alone.&nbsp; And I find you up, wandering homeless, and
picking farthings off dead women by the wayside!&nbsp; I fear no
man and nothing; I have seen you tremble and lose countenance at
a word.&nbsp; I wait God&rsquo;s summons contentedly in my own
house, or, if it please the king to call me out again, upon the
field of battle.&nbsp; You look for the gallows; a rough, swift
death, without hope or honour.&nbsp; Is there no difference
between these two?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;As far as to the moon,&rdquo; Villon acquiesced.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But if I had been born lord of Brisetout, and you had been
the poor scholar Francis, would the difference have been any the
less?&nbsp; Should not I have been warming my knees at this
charcoal pan, and would not you have been groping for farthings
in the snow?&nbsp; Should not I have been the soldier, and you
the thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;A thief!&rdquo; cried the old man.&nbsp; &ldquo;I a
thief!&nbsp; If you understood your words, you would repent
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villon turned out his hands with a gesture of inimitable
impudence.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your lordship had done me the honour
to follow my argument!&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do you too much honour in submitting to your
presence,&rdquo; said the knight.&nbsp; &ldquo;Learn to curb your
tongue when you speak with old and honourable men, or some one
hastier than I may reprove you in a sharper fashion.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And he rose and paced the lower end of the apartment, struggling
with anger and antipathy.&nbsp; Villon surreptitiously refilled
his cup, and settled himself more comfortably in the chair,
crossing his knees and leaning his head upon one hand and the
elbow against the back of the chair.&nbsp; He was now replete and
warm; and he was in nowise frightened for his host, having gauged
him as justly as was possible between two such different
characters.&nbsp; The night was far spent, and in a very
comfortable fashion after all; and he felt morally certain of a
safe departure on the morrow.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tell me one thing,&rdquo; said the old man, pausing in
his walk.&nbsp; &ldquo;Are you really a thief?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I claim the sacred rights of hospitality,&rdquo;
returned the poet.&nbsp; &ldquo;My lord, I am.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very young,&rdquo; the knight continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should never have been so old,&rdquo; replied Villon,
showing his fingers, &ldquo;if I had not helped myself with these
ten talents.&nbsp; They have been my nursing mothers and my
nursing fathers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You may still repent and change.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I repent daily,&rdquo; said the poet.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There are few people more given to repentance than poor
Francis.&nbsp; As for change, let somebody change my
circumstances.&nbsp; A man must continue to eat, if it were only
that he may continue to repent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The change must begin in the heart,&rdquo; returned the
old man solemnly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear lord,&rdquo; answered Villon, &ldquo;do you
really fancy that I steal for pleasure?&nbsp; I hate stealing,
like any other piece of work or of danger.&nbsp; My teeth chatter
when I see a gallows.&nbsp; But I must eat, I must drink, I must
mix in society of some sort.&nbsp; What the devil!&nbsp; Man is
not a solitary animal&mdash;<i>Cui Deus f&aelig;minam
tradit</i>.&nbsp; Make me king&rsquo;s pantler&mdash;make me
abbot of St. Denis; make me bailly of the Patatrac; and then I
shall be changed indeed.&nbsp; But as long as you leave me the
poor scholar Francis Villon, without a farthing, why, of course,
I remain the same.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The grace of God is all-powerful.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should be a heretic to question it,&rdquo; said
Francis.&nbsp; &ldquo;It has made you lord of Brisetout and
bailly of the Patatrac; it has given me nothing but the quick
wits under my hat and these ten toes upon my hands.&nbsp; May I
help myself to wine?&nbsp; I thank you respectfully.&nbsp; By
God&rsquo;s grace, you have a very superior vintage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The lord of Brisetout walked to and fro with his hands behind
his back.&nbsp; Perhaps he was not yet quite settled in his mind
about the parallel between thieves and soldiers; perhaps Villon
had interested him by some cross-thread of sympathy; perhaps his
wits were simply muddled by so much unfamiliar reasoning; but
whatever the cause, he somehow yearned to convert the young man
to a better way of thinking, and could not make up his mind to
drive him forth again into the street.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is something more than I can understand in
this,&rdquo; he said at length.&nbsp; &ldquo;Your mouth is full
of subtleties, and the devil has led you very far astray; but the
devil is only a very weak spirit before God&rsquo;s truth, and
all his subtleties vanish at a word of true honour, like darkness
at morning.&nbsp; Listen to me once more.&nbsp; I learned long
ago that a gentleman should live chivalrously and lovingly to
God, and the king, and his lady; and though I have seen many
strange things done, I have still striven to command my ways upon
that rule.&nbsp; It is not only written in all noble histories,
but in every man&rsquo;s heart, if he will take care to
read.&nbsp; You speak of food and wine, and I know very well that
hunger is a difficult trial to endure; but you do not speak of
other wants; you say nothing of honour, of faith to God and other
men, of courtesy, of love without reproach.&nbsp; It may be that
I am not very wise&mdash;and yet I think I am&mdash;but you seem
to me like one who has lost his way and made a great error in
life.&nbsp; You are attending to the little wants, and you have
totally forgotten the great and only real ones, like a man who
should be doctoring a toothache on the Judgment Day.&nbsp; For
such things as honour and love and faith are not only nobler than
food and drink, but indeed I think that we desire them more, and
suffer more sharply for their absence.&nbsp; I speak to you as I
think you will most easily understand me.&nbsp; Are you not,
while careful to fill your belly, disregarding another appetite
in your heart, which spoils the pleasure of your life and keeps
you continually wretched?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Villon was sensibly nettled under all this sermonising.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You think I have no sense of honour!&rdquo; he
cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m poor enough, God knows!&nbsp;
It&rsquo;s hard to see rich people with their gloves, and you
blowing in your hands.&nbsp; An empty belly is a bitter thing,
although you speak so lightly of it.&nbsp; If you had had as many
as I, perhaps you would change your tune.&nbsp; Any way I&rsquo;m
a thief&mdash;make the most of that&mdash;but I&rsquo;m not a
devil from hell, God strike me dead.&nbsp; I would have you to
know I&rsquo;ve an honour of my own, as good as yours, though I
don&rsquo;t prate about it all day long, as if it was a
God&rsquo;s miracle to have any.&nbsp; It seems quite natural to
me; I keep it in its box till it&rsquo;s wanted.&nbsp; Why now,
look you here, how long have I been in this room with you?&nbsp;
Did you not tell me you were alone in the house?&nbsp; Look at
your gold plate!&nbsp; You&rsquo;re strong, if you like, but
you&rsquo;re old and unarmed, and I have my knife.&nbsp; What did
I want but a jerk of the elbow and here would have been you with
the cold steel in your bowels, and there would have been me,
linking in the streets, with an armful of gold cups!&nbsp; Did
you suppose I hadn&rsquo;t wit enough to see that?&nbsp; And I
scorned the action.&nbsp; There are your damned goblets, as safe
as in a church; there are you, with your heart ticking as good as
new; and here am I, ready to go out again as poor as I came in,
with my one white that you threw in my teeth!&nbsp; And you think
I have no sense of honour&mdash;God strike me dead!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man stretched out his right arm.&nbsp; &ldquo;I will
tell you what you are,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;You are a
rogue, my man, an impudent and a black-hearted rogue and
vagabond.&nbsp; I have passed an hour with you.&nbsp; Oh! believe
me, I feel myself disgraced!&nbsp; And you have eaten and drunk
at my table.&nbsp; But now I am sick at your presence; the day
has come, and the night-bird should be off to his roost.&nbsp;
Will you go before, or after?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which you please,&rdquo; returned the poet,
rising.&nbsp; &ldquo;I believe you to be strictly
honourable.&rdquo;&nbsp; He thoughtfully emptied his cup.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wish I could add you were intelligent,&rdquo; he went
on, knocking on his head with his knuckles.&nbsp; &ldquo;Age,
age! the brains stiff and rheumatic.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old man preceded him from a point of self-respect; Villon
followed, whistling, with his thumbs in his girdle.</p>
<p>&ldquo;God pity you,&rdquo; said the lord of Brisetout at the
door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good-bye, papa,&rdquo; returned Villon with a
yawn.&nbsp; &ldquo;Many thanks for the cold mutton.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The door closed behind him.&nbsp; The dawn was breaking over
the white roofs.&nbsp; A chill, uncomfortable morning ushered in
the day.&nbsp; Villon stood and heartily stretched himself in the
middle of the road.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A very dull old gentleman,&rdquo; he thought.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I wonder what his goblets may be worth.&rdquo;</p>

SIRE DE MAL&Ecirc;TROIT&rsquo;S DOOR</h2>
<p><span class="smcap">Denis de Beaulieu</span> was not yet
two-and-twenty, but he counted himself a grown man, and a very
accomplished cavalier into the bargain.&nbsp; Lads were early
formed in that rough, warfaring epoch; and when one has been in a
pitched battle and a dozen raids, has killed one&rsquo;s man in
an honourable fashion, and knows a thing or two of strategy and
mankind, a certain swagger in the gait is surely to be
pardoned.&nbsp; He had put up his horse with due care, and supped
with due deliberation; and then, in a very agreeable frame of
mind, went out to pay a visit in the grey of the evening.&nbsp;
It was not a very wise proceeding on the young man&rsquo;s
part.&nbsp; He would have done better to remain beside the fire
or go decently to bed.&nbsp; For the town was full of the troops
of Burgundy and England under a mixed command; and though Denis
was there on safe-conduct, his safe-conduct was like to serve him
little on a chance encounter.</p>
<p>It was September 1429; the weather had fallen sharp; a flighty
piping wind, laden with showers, beat about the township; and the
dead leaves ran riot along the streets.&nbsp; Here and there a
window was already lighted up; and the noise of men-at-arms
making merry over supper within, came forth in fits and was
swallowed up and carried away by the wind.&nbsp; The night fell
swiftly; the flag of England, fluttering on the spire-top, grew
ever fainter and fainter against the flying clouds&mdash;a black
speck like a swallow in the tumultuous, leaden chaos of the
sky.&nbsp; As the night fell the wind rose, and began to hoot
under archways and roar amid the tree-tops in the valley below
the town.</p>
<p>Denis de Beaulieu walked fast and was soon knocking at his
friend&rsquo;s door; but though he promised himself to stay only
a little while and make an early return, his welcome was so
pleasant, and he found so much to delay him, that it was already
long past midnight before he said good-bye upon the
threshold.&nbsp; The wind had fallen again in the meanwhile; the
night was as black as the grave; not a star, nor a glimmer of
moonshine, slipped through the canopy of cloud.&nbsp; Denis was
ill-acquainted with the intricate lanes of Chateau Landon; even
by daylight he had found some trouble in picking his way; and in
this absolute darkness he soon lost it altogether.&nbsp; He was
certain of one thing only&mdash;to keep mounting the hill; for
his friend&rsquo;s house lay at the lower end, or tail, of
Chateau Landon, while the inn was up at the head, under the great
church spire.&nbsp; With this clue to go upon he stumbled and
groped forward, now breathing more freely in open places where
there was a good slice of sky overhead, now feeling along the
wall in stifling closes.&nbsp; It is an eerie and mysterious
position to be thus submerged in opaque blackness in an almost
unknown town.&nbsp; The silence is terrifying in its
possibilities.&nbsp; The touch of cold window bars to the
exploring hand startles the man like the touch of a toad; the
inequalities of the pavement shake his heart into his mouth; a
piece of denser darkness threatens an ambuscade or a chasm in the
pathway; and where the air is brighter, the houses put on strange
and bewildering appearances, as if to lead him farther from his
way.&nbsp; For Denis, who had to regain his inn without
attracting notice, there was real danger as well as mere
discomfort in the walk; and he went warily and boldly at once,
and at every corner paused to make an observation.</p>
<p>He had been for some time threading a lane so narrow that he
could touch a wall with either hand, when it began to open out
and go sharply downward.&nbsp; Plainly this lay no longer in the
direction of his inn; but the hope of a little more light tempted
him forward to reconnoitre.&nbsp; The lane ended in a terrace
with a bartizan wall, which gave an out-look between high houses,
as out of an embrasure, into the valley lying dark and formless
several hundred feet below.&nbsp; Denis looked down, and could
discern a few tree-tops waving and a single speck of brightness
where the river ran across a weir.&nbsp; The weather was clearing
up, and the sky had lightened, so as to show the outline of the
heavier clouds and the dark margin of the hills.&nbsp; By the
uncertain glimmer, the house on his left hand should be a place
of some pretensions; it was surmounted by several pinnacles and
turret-tops; the round stern of a chapel, with a fringe of flying
buttresses, projected boldly from the main block; and the door
was sheltered under a deep porch carved with figures and overhung
by two long gargoyles.&nbsp; The windows of the chapel gleamed
through their intricate tracery with a light as of many tapers,
and threw out the buttresses and the peaked roof in a more
intense blackness against the sky.&nbsp; It was plainly the hotel
of some great family of the neighbourhood; and as it reminded
Denis of a town house of his own at Bourges, he stood for some
time gazing up at it and mentally gauging the skill of the
architects and the consideration of the two families.</p>
<p>There seemed to be no issue to the terrace but the lane by
which he had reached it; he could only retrace his steps, but he
had gained some notion of his whereabouts, and hoped by this
means to hit the main thoroughfare and speedily regain the
inn.&nbsp; He was reckoning without that chapter of accidents
which was to make this night memorable above all others in his
career; for he had not gone back above a hundred yards before he
saw a light coming to meet him, and heard loud voices speaking
together in the echoing narrows of the lane.&nbsp; It was a party
of men-at-arms going the night round with torches.&nbsp; Denis
assured himself that they had all been making free with the
wine-bowl, and were in no mood to be particular about
safe-conducts or the niceties of chivalrous war.&nbsp; It was as
like as not that they would kill him like a dog and leave him
where he fell.&nbsp; The situation was inspiriting but
nervous.&nbsp; Their own torches would conceal him from sight, he
reflected; and he hoped that they would drown the noise of his
footsteps with their own empty voices.&nbsp; If he were but fleet
and silent, he might evade their notice altogether.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, as he turned to beat a retreat, his foot rolled
upon a pebble; he fell against the wall with an ejaculation, and
his sword rang loudly on the stones.&nbsp; Two or three voices
demanded who went there&mdash;some in French, some in English;
but Denis made no reply, and ran the faster down the lane.&nbsp;
Once upon the terrace, he paused to look back.&nbsp; They still
kept calling after him, and just then began to double the pace in
pursuit, with a considerable clank of armour, and great tossing
of the torchlight to and fro in the narrow jaws of the
passage.</p>
<p>Denis cast a look around and darted into the porch.&nbsp;
There he might escape observation, or&mdash;if that were too much
to expect&mdash;was in a capital posture whether for parley or
defence.&nbsp; So thinking, he drew his sword and tried to set
his back against the door.&nbsp; To his surprise, it yielded
behind his weight; and though he turned in a moment, continued to
swing back on oiled and noiseless hinges, until it stood wide
open on a black interior.&nbsp; When things fall out opportunely
for the person concerned, he is not apt to be critical about the
how or why, his own immediate personal convenience seeming a
sufficient reason for the strangest oddities and resolutions in
our sublunary things; and so Denis, without a moment&rsquo;s
hesitation, stepped within and partly closed the door behind him
to conceal his place of refuge.&nbsp; Nothing was further from
his thoughts than to close it altogether; but for some
inexplicable reason&mdash;perhaps by a spring or a
weight&mdash;the ponderous mass of oak whipped itself out of his
fingers and clanked to, with a formidable rumble and a noise like
the falling of an automatic bar.</p>
<p>The round, at that very moment, debouched upon the terrace and
proceeded to summon him with shouts and curses.&nbsp; He heard
them ferreting in the dark corners; the stock of a lance even
rattled along the outer surface of the door behind which he
stood; but these gentlemen were in too high a humour to be long
delayed, and soon made off down a corkscrew pathway which had
escaped Denis&rsquo;s observation, and passed out of sight and
hearing along the battlements of the town.</p>
<p>Denis breathed again.&nbsp; He gave them a few minutes&rsquo;
grace for fear of accidents, and then groped about for some means
of opening the door and slipping forth again.&nbsp; The inner
surface was quite smooth, not a handle, not a moulding, not a
projection of any sort.&nbsp; He got his finger-nails round the
edges and pulled, but the mass was immovable.&nbsp; He shook it,
it was as firm as a rock.&nbsp; Denis de Beaulieu frowned and
gave vent to a little noiseless whistle.&nbsp; What ailed the
door? he wondered.&nbsp; Why was it open?&nbsp; How came it to
shut so easily and so effectually after him?&nbsp; There was
something obscure and underhand about all this, that was little
to the young man&rsquo;s fancy.&nbsp; It looked like a snare; and
yet who could suppose a snare in such a quiet by-street and in a
house of so prosperous and even noble an exterior?&nbsp; And
yet&mdash;snare or no snare, intentionally or
unintentionally&mdash;here he was, prettily trapped; and for the
life of him he could see no way out of it again.&nbsp; The
darkness began to weigh upon him.&nbsp; He gave ear; all was
silent without, but within and close by he seemed to catch a
faint sighing, a faint sobbing rustle, a little stealthy
creak&mdash;as though many persons were at his side, holding
themselves quite still, and governing even their respiration with
the extreme of slyness.&nbsp; The idea went to his vitals with a
shock, and he faced about suddenly as if to defend his
life.&nbsp; Then, for the first time, he became aware of a light
about the level of his eyes and at some distance in the interior
of the house&mdash;a vertical thread of light, widening towards
the bottom, such as might escape between two wings of arras over
a doorway.&nbsp; To see anything was a relief to Denis; it was
like a piece of solid ground to a man labouring in a morass; his
mind seized upon it with avidity; and he stood staring at it and
trying to piece together some logical conception of his
surroundings.&nbsp; Plainly there was a flight of steps ascending
from his own level to that of this illuminated doorway; and
indeed he thought he could make out another thread of light, as
fine as a needle and as faint as phosphorescence, which might
very well be reflected along the polished wood of a
handrail.&nbsp; Since he had begun to suspect that he was not
alone, his heart had continued to beat with smothering violence,
and an intolerable desire for action of any sort had possessed
itself of his spirit.&nbsp; He was in deadly peril, he
believed.&nbsp; What could be more natural than to mount the
staircase, lift the curtain, and confront his difficulty at
once?&nbsp; At least he would be dealing with something tangible;
at least he would be no longer in the dark.&nbsp; He stepped
slowly forward with outstretched hands, until his foot struck the
bottom step; then he rapidly scaled the stairs, stood for a
moment to compose his expression, lifted the arras and went
in.</p>
<p>He found himself in a large apartment of polished stone.&nbsp;
There were three doors; one on each of three sides; all similarly
curtained with tapestry.&nbsp; The fourth side was occupied by
two large windows and a great stone chimney-piece, carved with
the arms of the Mal&eacute;troits.&nbsp; Denis recognised the
bearings, and was gratified to find himself in such good
hands.&nbsp; The room was strongly illuminated; but it contained
little furniture except a heavy table and a chair or two, the
hearth was innocent of fire, and the pavement was but sparsely
strewn with rushes clearly many days old.</p>
<p>On a high chair beside the chimney, and directly facing Denis
as he entered, sat a little old gentleman in a fur tippet.&nbsp;
He sat with his legs crossed and his hands folded, and a cup of
spiced wine stood by his elbow on a bracket on the wall.&nbsp;
His countenance had a strongly masculine cast; not properly
human, but such as we see in the bull, the goat, or the domestic
boar; something equivocal and wheedling, something greedy,
brutal, and dangerous.&nbsp; The upper lip was inordinately full,
as though swollen by a blow or a toothache; and the smile, the
peaked eyebrows, and the small, strong eyes were quaintly and
almost comically evil in expression.&nbsp; Beautiful white hair
hung straight all round his head, like a saint&rsquo;s, and fell
in a single curl upon the tippet.&nbsp; His beard and moustache
were the pink of venerable sweetness.&nbsp; Age, probably in
consequence of inordinate precautions, had left no mark upon his
hands; and the Mal&eacute;troit hand was famous.&nbsp; It would
be difficult to imagine anything at once so fleshy and so
delicate in design; the taper, sensual fingers were like those of
one of Leonardo&rsquo;s women; the fork of the thumb made a
dimpled protuberance when closed; the nails were perfectly
shaped, and of a dead, surprising whiteness.&nbsp; It rendered
his aspect tenfold more redoubtable, that a man with hands like
these should keep them devoutly folded in his lap like a virgin
martyr&mdash;that a man with so intense and startling an
expression of face should sit patiently on his seat and
contemplate people with an unwinking stare, like a god, or a
god&rsquo;s statue.&nbsp; His quiescence seemed ironical and
treacherous, it fitted so poorly with his looks.</p>
<p>Such was Alain, Sire de Mal&eacute;troit.</p>
<p>Denis and he looked silently at each other for a second or
two.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pray step in,&rdquo; said the Sire de
Mal&eacute;troit.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have been expecting you all the
evening.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had not risen, but he accompanied his words with a smile
and a slight but courteous inclination of the head.&nbsp; Partly
from the smile, partly from the strange musical murmur with which
the Sire prefaced his observation, Denis felt a strong shudder of
disgust go through his marrow.&nbsp; And what with disgust and
honest confusion of mind, he could scarcely get words together in
reply.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I fear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that this is a double
accident.&nbsp; I am not the person you suppose me.&nbsp; It
seems you were looking for a visit; but for my part, nothing was
further from my thoughts&mdash;nothing could be more contrary to
my wishes&mdash;than this intrusion.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, well,&rdquo; replied the old gentleman
indulgently, &ldquo;here you are, which is the main point.&nbsp;
Seat yourself, my friend, and put yourself entirely at your
ease.&nbsp; We shall arrange our little affairs
presently.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis perceived that the matter was still complicated with
some misconception, and he hastened to continue his
explanations.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Your door . . . &rdquo; he began.</p>
<p>&ldquo;About my door?&rdquo; asked the other, raising his
peaked eyebrows.&nbsp; &ldquo;A little piece of
ingenuity.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A hospitable fancy!&nbsp; By your own account, you were
not desirous of making my acquaintance.&nbsp; We old people look
for such reluctance now and then; and when it touches our honour,
we cast about until we find some way of overcoming it.&nbsp; You
arrive uninvited, but believe me, very welcome.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You persist in error, sir,&rdquo; said Denis.&nbsp;
&ldquo;There can be no question between you and me.&nbsp; I am a
stranger in this countryside.&nbsp; My name is Denis, damoiseau
de Beaulieu.&nbsp; If you see me in your house, it is
only&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My young friend,&rdquo; interrupted the other,
&ldquo;you will permit me to have my own ideas on that
subject.&nbsp; They probably differ from yours at the present
moment,&rdquo; he added with a leer, &ldquo;but time will show
which of us is in the right.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis was convinced he had to do with a lunatic.&nbsp; He
seated himself with a shrug, content to wait the upshot; and a
pause ensued, during which he thought he could distinguish a
hurried gabbling as of prayer from behind the arras immediately
opposite him.&nbsp; Sometimes there seemed to be but one person
engaged, sometimes two; and the vehemence of the voice, low as it
was, seemed to indicate either great haste or an agony of
spirit.&nbsp; It occurred to him that this piece of tapestry
covered the entrance to the chapel he had noticed from
without.</p>
<p>The old gentleman meanwhile surveyed Denis from head to foot
with a smile, and from time to time emitted little noises like a
bird or a mouse, which seemed to indicate a high degree of
satisfaction.&nbsp; This state of matters became rapidly
insupportable; and Denis, to put an end to it, remarked politely
that the wind had gone down.</p>
<p>The old gentleman fell into a fit of silent laughter, so
prolonged and violent that he became quite red in the face.&nbsp;
Denis got upon his feet at once, and put on his hat with a
flourish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are in your wits,
you have affronted me grossly.&nbsp; If you are out of them, I
flatter myself I can find better employment for my brains than to
talk with lunatics.&nbsp; My conscience is clear; you have made a
fool of me from the first moment; you have refused to hear my
explanations; and now there is no power under God will make me
stay here any longer; and if I cannot make my way out in a more
decent fashion, I will hack your door in pieces with my
sword.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sire de Mal&eacute;troit raised his right hand and wagged
it at Denis with the fore and little fingers extended.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear nephew,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;sit
down.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nephew!&rdquo; retorted Denis, &ldquo;you lie in your
throat;&rdquo; and he snapped his fingers in his face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sit down, you rogue!&rdquo; cried the old gentleman, in
a sudden, harsh voice, like the barking of a dog.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do
you fancy,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that when I had made my
little contrivance for the door I had stopped short with
that?&nbsp; If you prefer to be bound hand and foot till your
bones ache, rise and try to go away.&nbsp; If you choose to
remain a free young buck, agreeably conversing with an old
gentleman&mdash;why, sit where you are in peace, and God be with
you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean I am a prisoner?&rdquo; demanded Denis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I state the facts,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I would rather leave the conclusion to
yourself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis sat down again.&nbsp; Externally he managed to keep
pretty calm; but within, he was now boiling with anger, now
chilled with apprehension.&nbsp; He no longer felt convinced that
he was dealing with a madman.&nbsp; And if the old gentleman was
sane, what, in God&rsquo;s name, had he to look for?&nbsp; What
absurd or tragical adventure had befallen him?&nbsp; What
countenance was he to assume?</p>
<p>While he was thus unpleasantly reflecting, the arras that
overhung the chapel door was raised, and a tall priest in his
robes came forth and, giving a long, keen stare at Denis, said
something in an undertone to Sire de Mal&eacute;troit.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is in a better frame of spirit?&rdquo; asked the
latter.</p>
<p>&ldquo;She is more resigned, messire,&rdquo; replied the
priest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now the Lord help her, she is hard to please!&rdquo;
sneered the old gentleman.&nbsp; &ldquo;A likely
stripling&mdash;not ill-born&mdash;and of her own choosing,
too?&nbsp; Why, what more would the jade have?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The situation is not usual for a young damsel,&rdquo;
said the other, &ldquo;and somewhat trying to her
blushes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;She should have thought of that before she began the
dance.&nbsp; It was none of my choosing, God knows that: but
since she is in it, by our Lady, she shall carry it to the
end.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then addressing Denis, &ldquo;Monsieur de
Beaulieu,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;may I present you to my
niece?&nbsp; She has been waiting your arrival, I may say, with
even greater impatience than myself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis had resigned himself with a good grace&mdash;all he
desired was to know the worst of it as speedily as possible; so
he rose at once, and bowed in acquiescence.&nbsp; The Sire de
Mal&eacute;troit followed his example and limped, with the
assistance of the chaplain&rsquo;s arm, towards the chapel
door.&nbsp; The priest pulled aside the arras, and all three
entered.&nbsp; The building had considerable architectural
pretensions.&nbsp; A light groining sprang from six stout
columns, and hung down in two rich pendants from the centre of
the vault.&nbsp; The place terminated behind the altar in a round
end, embossed and honeycombed with a superfluity of ornament in
relief, and pierced by many little windows shaped like stars,
trefoils, or wheels.&nbsp; These windows were imperfectly glazed,
so that the night air circulated freely in the chapel.&nbsp; The
tapers, of which there must have been half a hundred burning on
the altar, were unmercifully blown about; and the light went
through many different phases of brilliancy and
semi-eclipse.&nbsp; On the steps in front of the altar knelt a
young girl richly attired as a bride.&nbsp; A chill settled over
Denis as he observed her costume; he fought with desperate energy
against the conclusion that was being thrust upon his mind; it
could not&mdash;it should not&mdash;be as he feared.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; said the Sire, in his most flute-like
tones, &ldquo;I have brought a friend to see you, my little girl;
turn round and give him your pretty hand.&nbsp; It is good to be
devout; but it is necessary to be polite, my niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The girl rose to her feet and turned towards the new
comers.&nbsp; She moved all of a piece; and shame and exhaustion
were expressed in every line of her fresh young body; and she
held her head down and kept her eyes upon the pavement, as she
came slowly forward.&nbsp; In the course of her advance, her eyes
fell upon Denis de Beaulieu&rsquo;s feet&mdash;feet of which he
was justly vain, be it remarked, and wore in the most elegant
accoutrement even while travelling.&nbsp; She
paused&mdash;started, as if his yellow boots had conveyed some
shocking meaning&mdash;and glanced suddenly up into the
wearer&rsquo;s countenance.&nbsp; Their eyes met; shame gave
place to horror and terror in her looks; the blood left her lips;
with a piercing scream she covered her face with her hands and
sank upon the chapel floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That is not the man!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;My
uncle, that in not the man!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sire de Mal&eacute;troit chirped agreeably.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I expected as
much.&nbsp; It was so unfortunate you could not remember his
name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;indeed, I have never
seen this person till this moment&mdash;I have never so much as
set eyes upon him&mdash;I never wish to see him again.&nbsp;
Sir,&rdquo; she said, turning to Denis, &ldquo;if you are a
gentleman, you will bear me out.&nbsp; Have I ever seen
you&mdash;have you ever seen me&mdash;before this accursed
hour?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To speak for myself, I have never had that
pleasure,&rdquo; answered the young man.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is the
first time, messire, that I have met with your engaging
niece.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The old gentleman shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am distressed to hear it,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But it is never too late to begin.&nbsp; I had little more
acquaintance with my own late lady ere I married her; which
proves,&rdquo; he added with a grimace, &ldquo;that these
impromptu marriages may often produce an excellent understanding
in the long-run.&nbsp; As the bridegroom is to have a voice in
the matter, I will give him two hours to make up for lost time
before we proceed with the ceremony.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned
towards the door, followed by the clergyman.</p>
<p>The girl was on her feet in a moment.&nbsp; &ldquo;My uncle,
you cannot be in earnest,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I declare
before God I will stab myself rather than be forced on that young
man.&nbsp; The heart rises at it; God forbids such marriages; you
dishonour your white hair.&nbsp; Oh, my uncle, pity me!&nbsp;
There is not a woman in all the world but would prefer death to
such a nuptial.&nbsp; Is it possible,&rdquo; she added,
faltering&mdash;&ldquo;is it possible that you do not believe
me&mdash;that you still think this&rdquo;&mdash;and she pointed
at Denis with a tremor of anger and contempt&mdash;&ldquo;that
you still think <i>this</i> to be the man?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly,&rdquo; said the old gentleman, pausing on the
threshold, &ldquo;I do.&nbsp; But let me explain to you once for
all, Blanche de Mal&eacute;troit, my way of thinking about this
affair.&nbsp; When you took it into your head to dishonour my
family and the name that I have borne, in peace and war, for more
than three-score years, you forfeited, not only the right to
question my designs, but that of looking me in the face.&nbsp; If
your father had been alive, he would have spat on you and turned
you out of doors.&nbsp; His was the hand of iron.&nbsp; You may
bless your God you have only to deal with the hand of velvet,
mademoiselle.&nbsp; It was my duty to get you married without
delay.&nbsp; Out of pure goodwill, I have tried to find your own
gallant for you.&nbsp; And I believe I have succeeded.&nbsp; But
before God and all the holy angels, Blanche de Mal&eacute;troit,
if I have not, I care not one jack-straw.&nbsp; So let me
recommend you to be polite to our young friend; for upon my word,
your next groom may be less appetising.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And with that he went out, with the chaplain at his heels; and
the arras fell behind the pair.</p>
<p>The girl turned upon Denis with flashing eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And what, sir,&rdquo; she demanded, &ldquo;may be the
meaning of all this?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;God knows,&rdquo; returned Denis gloomily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am a prisoner in this house, which seems full of mad
people.&nbsp; More I know not; and nothing do I
understand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And pray how came you here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>
<p>He told her as briefly as he could.&nbsp; &ldquo;For the
rest,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;perhaps you will follow my example,
and tell me the answer to all these riddles, and what, in
God&rsquo;s name, is like to be the end of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She stood silent for a little, and he could see her lips
tremble and her tearless eyes burn with a feverish lustre.&nbsp;
Then she pressed her forehead in both hands.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, how my head aches!&rdquo; she said
wearily&mdash;&ldquo;to say nothing of my poor heart!&nbsp; But
it is due to you to know my story, unmaidenly as it must
seem.&nbsp; I am called Blanche de Mal&eacute;troit; I have been
without father or mother for&mdash;oh! for as long as I can
recollect, and indeed I have been most unhappy all my life.&nbsp;
Three months ago a young captain began to stand near me every day
in church.&nbsp; I could see that I pleased him; I am much to
blame, but I was so glad that any one should love me; and when he
passed me a letter, I took it home with me and read it with great
pleasure.&nbsp; Since that time he has written many.&nbsp; He was
so anxious to speak with me, poor fellow! and kept asking me to
leave the door open some evening that we might have two words
upon the stair.&nbsp; For he knew how much my uncle trusted
me.&rdquo;&nbsp; She gave something like a sob at that, and it
was a moment before she could go on.&nbsp; &ldquo;My uncle is a
hard man, but he is very shrewd,&rdquo; she said at last.&nbsp;
&ldquo;He has performed many feats in war, and was a great person
at court, and much trusted by Queen Isabeau in old days.&nbsp;
How he came to suspect me I cannot tell; but it is hard to keep
anything from his knowledge; and this morning, as we came from
mass, he took my hand in his, forced it open, and read my little
billet, walking by my side all the while.&nbsp; When he had
finished, he gave it back to me with great politeness.&nbsp; It
contained another request to have the door left open; and this
has been the ruin of us all.&nbsp; My uncle kept me strictly in
my room until evening, and then ordered me to dress myself as you
see me&mdash;a hard mockery for a young girl, do you not think
so?&nbsp; I suppose, when he could not prevail with me to tell
him the young captain&rsquo;s name, he must have laid a trap for
him: into which, alas! you have fallen in the anger of God.&nbsp;
I looked for much confusion; for how could I tell whether he was
willing to take me for his wife on these sharp terms?&nbsp; He
might have been trifling with me from the first; or I might have
made myself too cheap in his eyes.&nbsp; But truly I had not
looked for such a shameful punishment as this!&nbsp; I could not
think that God would let a girl be so disgraced before a young
man.&nbsp; And now I have told you all; and I can scarcely hope
that you will not despise me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis made her a respectful inclination.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you have honoured me by
your confidence.&nbsp; It remains for me to prove that I am not
unworthy of the honour.&nbsp; Is Messire de Mal&eacute;troit at
hand?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe he is writing in the salle without,&rdquo;
she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;May I lead you thither, madam?&rdquo; asked Denis,
offering his hand with his most courtly bearing.</p>
<p>She accepted it; and the pair passed out of the chapel,
Blanche in a very drooping and shamefast condition, but Denis
strutting and ruffling in the consciousness of a mission, and the
boyish certainty of accomplishing it with honour.</p>
<p>The Sire de Mal&eacute;troit rose to meet them with an
ironical obeisance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said Denis, with the grandest possible air,
&ldquo;I believe I am to have some say in the matter of this
marriage; and let me tell you at once, I will be no party to
forcing the inclination of this young lady.&nbsp; Had it been
freely offered to me, I should have been proud to accept her
hand, for I perceive she is as good as she is beautiful; but as
things are, I have now the honour, messire, of
refusing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Blanche looked at him with gratitude in her eyes; but the old
gentleman only smiled and smiled, until his smile grew positively
sickening to Denis.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;Monsieur de
Beaulieu, that you do not perfectly understand the choice I have
to offer you.&nbsp; Follow me, I beseech you, to this
window.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he led the way to one of the large
windows which stood open on the night.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
observe,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;there is an iron ring in the
upper masonry, and reeved through that, a very efficacious
rope.&nbsp; Now, mark my words; if you should find your
disinclination to my niece&rsquo;s person insurmountable, I shall
have you hanged out of this window before sunrise.&nbsp; I shall
only proceed to such an extremity with the greatest regret, you
may believe me.&nbsp; For it is not at all your death that I
desire, but my niece&rsquo;s establishment in life.&nbsp; At the
same time, it must come to that if you prove obstinate.&nbsp;
Your family, Monsieur de Beaulieu, is very well in its way; but
if you sprang from Charlemagne, you should not refuse the hand of
a Mal&eacute;troit with impunity&mdash;not if she had been as
common as the Paris road&mdash;not if she were as hideous as the
gargoyle over my door.&nbsp; Neither my niece nor you, nor my own
private feelings, move me at all in this matter.&nbsp; The honour
of my house has been compromised; I believe you to be the guilty
person; at least you are now in the secret; and you can hardly
wonder if I request you to wipe out the stain.&nbsp; If you will
not, your blood be on your own head!&nbsp; It will be no great
satisfaction to me to have your interesting relics kicking their
heels in the breeze below my windows; but half a loaf is better
than no bread, and if I cannot cure the dishonour, I shall at
least stop the scandal.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There was a pause.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe there are other ways of settling such
imbroglios among gentlemen,&rdquo; said Denis.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
wear a sword, and I hear you have used it with
distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Sire de Mal&eacute;troit made a signal to the chaplain,
who crossed the room with long silent strides and raised the
arras over the third of the three doors.&nbsp; It was only a
moment before he let it fall again; but Denis had time to see a
dusky passage full of armed men.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When I was a little younger, I should have been
delighted to honour you, Monsieur de Beaulieu,&rdquo; said Sire
Alain; &ldquo;but I am now too old.&nbsp; Faithful retainers are
the sinews of age, and I must employ the strength I have.&nbsp;
This is one of the hardest things to swallow as a man grows up in
years; but with a little patience, even this becomes
habitual.&nbsp; You and the lady seem to prefer the salle for
what remains of your two hours; and as I have no desire to cross
your preference, I shall resign it to your use with all the
pleasure in the world.&nbsp; No haste!&rdquo; he added, holding
up his hand, as he saw a dangerous look come into Denis de
Beaulieu&rsquo;s face.&nbsp; &ldquo;If your mind revolts against
hanging, it will be time enough two hours hence to throw yourself
out of the window or upon the pikes of my retainers.&nbsp; Two
hours of life are always two hours.&nbsp; A great many things may
turn up in even as little a while as that.&nbsp; And, besides, if
I understand her appearance, my niece has still something to say
to you.&nbsp; You will not disfigure your last hours by a want of
politeness to a lady?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis looked at Blanche, and she made him an imploring
gesture.</p>
<p>It is likely that the old gentleman was hugely pleased at this
symptom of an understanding; for he smiled on both, and added
sweetly: &ldquo;If you will give me your word of honour, Monsieur
de Beaulieu, to await my return at the end of the two hours
before attempting anything desperate, I shall withdraw my
retainers, and let you speak in greater privacy with
mademoiselle.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis again glanced at the girl, who seemed to beseech him to
agree.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I give you my word of honour,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>Messire de Mal&eacute;troit bowed, and proceeded to limp about
the apartment, clearing his throat the while with that odd
musical chirp which had already grown so irritating in the ears
of Denis de Beaulieu.&nbsp; He first possessed himself of some
papers which lay upon the table; then he went to the mouth of the
passage and appeared to give an order to the men behind the
arras; and lastly he hobbled out through the door by which Denis
had come in, turning upon the threshold to address a last smiling
bow to the young couple, and followed by the chaplain with a
hand-lamp.</p>
<p>No sooner were they alone than Blanche advanced towards Denis
with her hands extended.&nbsp; Her face was flushed and excited,
and her eyes shone with tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not die!&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;you shall
marry me after all.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You seem to think, madam,&rdquo; replied Denis,
&ldquo;that I stand much in fear of death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I see you are no
poltroon.&nbsp; It is for my own sake&mdash;I could not bear to
have you slain for such a scruple.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am afraid,&rdquo; returned Denis, &ldquo;that you
underrate the difficulty, madam.&nbsp; What you may be too
generous to refuse, I may be too proud to accept.&nbsp; In a
moment of noble feeling towards me, you forgot what you perhaps
owe to others.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the decency to keep his eyes upon the floor as he said
this, and after he had finished, so as not to spy upon her
confusion.&nbsp; She stood silent for a moment, then walked
suddenly away, and falling on her uncle&rsquo;s chair, fairly
burst out sobbing.&nbsp; Denis was in the acme of
embarrassment.&nbsp; He looked round, as if to seek for
inspiration, and seeing a stool, plumped down upon it for
something to do.&nbsp; There he sat, playing with the guard of
his rapier, and wishing himself dead a thousand times over, and
buried in the nastiest kitchen-heap in France.&nbsp; His eyes
wandered round the apartment, but found nothing to arrest
them.&nbsp; There were such wide spaces between the furniture,
the light fell so baldly and cheerlessly over all, the dark
outside air looked in so coldly through the windows, that he
thought he had never seen a church so vast, nor a tomb so
melancholy.&nbsp; The regular sobs of Blanche de Mal&eacute;troit
measured out the time like the ticking of a clock.&nbsp; He read
the device upon the shield over and over again, until his eyes
became obscured; he stared into shadowy corners until he imagined
they were swarming with horrible animals; and every now and again
he awoke with a start, to remember that his last two hours were
running, and death was on the march.</p>
<p>Oftener and oftener, as the time went on, did his glance
settle on the girl herself.&nbsp; Her face was bowed forward and
covered with her hands, and she was shaken at intervals by the
convulsive hiccup of grief.&nbsp; Even thus she was not an
unpleasant object to dwell upon, so plump and yet so fine, with a
warm brown skin, and the most beautiful hair, Denis thought, in
the whole world of womankind.&nbsp; Her hands were like her
uncle&rsquo;s; but they were more in place at the end of her
young arms, and looked infinitely soft and caressing.&nbsp; He
remembered how her blue eyes had shone upon him, full of anger,
pity, and innocence.&nbsp; And the more he dwelt on her
perfections, the uglier death looked, and the more deeply was he
smitten with penitence at her continued tears.&nbsp; Now he felt
that no man could have the courage to leave a world which
contained so beautiful a creature; and now he would have given
forty minutes of his last hour to have unsaid his cruel
speech.</p>
<p>Suddenly a hoarse and ragged peal of cockcrow rose to their
ears from the dark valley below the windows.&nbsp; And this
shattering noise in the silence of all around was like a light in
a dark place, and shook them both out of their reflections.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Alas, can I do nothing to help you?&rdquo; she said,
looking up.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; replied Denis, with a fine irrelevancy,
&ldquo;if I have said anything to wound you, believe me, it was
for your own sake and not for mine.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She thanked him with a tearful look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I feel your position cruelly,&rdquo; he went on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;The world has been bitter hard on you.&nbsp; Your uncle is
a disgrace to mankind.&nbsp; Believe me, madam, there is no young
gentleman in all France but would be glad of my opportunity, to
die in doing you a momentary service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know already that you can be very brave and
generous,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;What I <i>want</i> to
know is whether I can serve you&mdash;now or afterwards,&rdquo;
she added, with a quaver.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Most certainly,&rdquo; he answered with a smile.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Let me sit beside you as if I were a friend, instead of a
foolish intruder; try to forget how awkwardly we are placed to
one another; make my last moments go pleasantly; and you will do
me the chief service possible.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very gallant,&rdquo; she added, with a yet
deeper sadness . . . &ldquo;very gallant . . . and it somehow
pains me.&nbsp; But draw nearer, if you please; and if you find
anything to say to me, you will at least make certain of a very
friendly listener.&nbsp; Ah! Monsieur de Beaulieu,&rdquo; she
broke forth&mdash;&ldquo;ah!&nbsp; Monsieur de Beaulieu, how can
I look you in the face?&rdquo;&nbsp; And she fell to weeping
again with a renewed effusion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Madam,&rdquo; said Denis, taking her hand in both of
his, &ldquo;reflect on the little time I have before me, and the
great bitterness into which I am cast by the sight of your
distress.&nbsp; Spare me, in my last moments, the spectacle of
what I cannot cure even with the sacrifice of my life.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very selfish,&rdquo; answered Blanche.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I will be braver, Monsieur de Beaulieu, for your
sake.&nbsp; But think if I can do you no kindness in the
future&mdash;if you have no friends to whom I could carry your
adieux.&nbsp; Charge me as heavily as you can; every burden will
lighten, by so little, the invaluable gratitude I owe you.&nbsp;
Put it in my power to do something more for you than
weep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My mother is married again, and has a young family to
care for.&nbsp; My brother Guichard will inherit my fiefs; and if
I am not in error, that will content him amply for my
death.&nbsp; Life is a little vapour that passeth away, as we are
told by those in holy orders.&nbsp; When a man is in a fair way
and sees all life open in front of him, he seems to himself to
make a very important figure in the world.&nbsp; His horse
whinnies to him; the trumpets blow and the girls look out of
window as he rides into town before his company; he receives many
assurances of trust and regard&mdash;sometimes by express in a
letter&mdash;sometimes face to face, with persons of great
consequence falling on his neck.&nbsp; It is not wonderful if his
head is turned for a time.&nbsp; But once he is dead, were he as
brave as Hercules or as wise as Solomon, he is soon
forgotten.&nbsp; It is not ten years since my father fell, with
many other knights around him, in a very fierce encounter, and I
do not think that any one of them, nor so much as the name of the
fight, is now remembered.&nbsp; No, no, madam, the nearer you
come to it, you see that death is a dark and dusty corner, where
a man gets into his tomb and has the door shut after him till the
judgment day.&nbsp; I have few friends just now, and once I am
dead I shall have none.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, Monsieur de Beaulieu!&rdquo; she exclaimed,
&ldquo;you forget Blanche de Mal&eacute;troit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have a sweet nature, madam, and you are pleased to
estimate a little service far beyond its worth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is not that,&rdquo; she answered.&nbsp; &ldquo;You
mistake me if you think I am so easily touched by my own
concerns.&nbsp; I say so, because you are the noblest man I have
ever met; because I recognise in you a spirit that would have
made even a common person famous in the land.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And yet here I die in a mouse-trap&mdash;with no more
noise about it than my own squeaking,&rdquo; answered he.</p>
<p>A look of pain crossed her face, and she was silent for a
little while.&nbsp; Then a fight came into her eyes, and with a
smile she spoke again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I cannot have my champion think meanly of
himself.&nbsp; Any one who gives his life for another will be met
in Paradise by all the heralds and angels of the Lord God.&nbsp;
And you have no such cause to hang your head.&nbsp; For . . .
Pray, do you think me beautiful?&rdquo; she asked, with a deep
flush.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, madam, I do,&rdquo; he said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am glad of that,&rdquo; she answered heartily.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Do you think there are many men in France who have been
asked in marriage by a beautiful maiden&mdash;with her own
lips&mdash;and who have refused her to her face?&nbsp; I know you
men would half despise such a triumph; but believe me, we women
know more of what is precious in love.&nbsp; There is nothing
that should set a person higher in his own esteem; and we women
would prize nothing more dearly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but you
cannot make me forget that I was asked in pity and not for
love.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am not so sure of that,&rdquo; she replied, holding
down her head.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hear me to an end, Monsieur de
Beaulieu.&nbsp; I know how you must despise me; I feel you are
right to do so; I am too poor a creature to occupy one thought of
your mind, although, alas! you must die for me this
morning.&nbsp; But when I asked you to marry me, indeed, and
indeed, it was because I respected and admired you, and loved you
with my whole soul, from the very moment that you took my part
against my uncle.&nbsp; If you had seen yourself, and how noble
you looked, you would pity rather than despise me.&nbsp; And
now,&rdquo; she went on, hurriedly checking him with her hand,
&ldquo;although I have laid aside all reserve and told you so
much, remember that I know your sentiments towards me
already.&nbsp; I would not, believe me, being nobly born, weary
you with importunities into consent.&nbsp; I too have a pride of
my own: and I declare before the holy mother of God, if you
should now go back from your word already given, I would no more
marry you than I would marry my uncle&rsquo;s groom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Denis smiled a little bitterly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is a small love,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that shies
at a little pride.&rdquo;</p>
<p>She made no answer, although she probably had her own
thoughts.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come hither to the window,&rdquo; he said, with a
sigh.&nbsp; &ldquo;Here is the dawn.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And indeed the dawn was already beginning.&nbsp; The hollow of
the sky was full of essential daylight, colourless and clean; and
the valley underneath was flooded with a grey reflection.&nbsp; A
few thin vapours clung in the coves of the forest or lay along
the winding course of the river.&nbsp; The scene disengaged a
surprising effect of stillness, which was hardly interrupted when
the cocks began once more to crow among the steadings.&nbsp;
Perhaps the same fellow who had made so horrid a clangour in the
darkness not half-an-hour before, now sent up the merriest cheer
to greet the coming day.&nbsp; A little wind went bustling and
eddying among the tree-tops underneath the windows.&nbsp; And
still the daylight kept flooding insensibly out of the east,
which was soon to grow incandescent and cast up that red-hot
cannon-ball, the rising sun.</p>
<p>Denis looked out over all this with a bit of a shiver.&nbsp;
He had taken her hand, and retained it in his almost
unconsciously.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has the day begun already?&rdquo; she said; and then,
illogically enough: &ldquo;the night has been so long!&nbsp;
Alas, what shall we say to my uncle when he returns?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What you will,&rdquo; said Denis, and he pressed her
fingers in his.</p>
<p>She was silent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Blanche,&rdquo; he said, with a swift, uncertain,
passionate utterance, &ldquo;you have seen whether I fear
death.&nbsp; You must know well enough that I would as gladly
leap out of that window into the empty air as lay a finger on you
without your free and full consent.&nbsp; But if you care for me
at all do not let me lose my life in a misapprehension; for I
love you better than the whole world; and though I will die for
you blithely, it would be like all the joys of Paradise to live
on and spend my life in your service.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As he stopped speaking, a bell began to ring loudly in the
interior of the house; and a clatter of armour in the corridor
showed that the retainers were returning to their post, and the
two hours were at an end.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all that you have heard?&rdquo; she whispered,
leaning towards him with her lips and eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have heard nothing,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The captain&rsquo;s name was Florimond de
Champdivers,&rdquo; she said in his ear.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did not hear it,&rdquo; he answered, taking her
supple body in his arms and covering her wet face with
kisses.</p>
<p>A melodious chirping was audible behind, followed by a
beautiful chuckle, and the voice of Messire de Mal&eacute;troit
wished his new nephew a good morning.</p>

292</span>PROVIDENCE AND THE GUITAR</h2>
<h3>CHAPTER I</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">Monsieur L&eacute;on Berthelini</span> had
a great care of his appearance, and sedulously suited his
deportment to the costume of the hour.&nbsp; He affected
something Spanish in his air, and something of the bandit, with a
flavour of Rembrandt at home.&nbsp; In person he was decidedly
small and inclined to be stout; his face was the picture of good
humour; his dark eyes, which were very expressive, told of a kind
heart, a brisk, merry nature, and the most indefatigable
spirits.&nbsp; If he had worn the clothes of the period you would
have set him down for a hitherto undiscovered hybrid between the
barber, the innkeeper, and the affable dispensing chemist.&nbsp;
But in the outrageous bravery of velvet jacket and flapped hat,
with trousers that were more accurately described as fleshings, a
white handkerchief cavalierly knotted at his neck, a shock of
Olympian curls upon his brow, and his feet shod through all
weathers in the slenderest of Moli&egrave;re shoes&mdash;you had
but to look at him and you knew you were in the presence of a
Great Creature.&nbsp; When he wore an overcoat he scorned to pass
the sleeves; a single button held it round his shoulders; it was
tossed backwards after the manner of a cloak, and carried with
the gait and presence of an Almaviva.&nbsp; I am of opinion that
M. Berthelini was nearing forty.&nbsp; But he had a boy&rsquo;s
heart, gloried in his finery, and walked through life like a
child in a perpetual dramatic performance.&nbsp; If he were not
Almaviva after all, it was not for lack of making believe.&nbsp;
And he enjoyed the artist&rsquo;s compensation.&nbsp; If he were
not really Almaviva, he was sometimes just as happy as though he
were.</p>
<p>I have seen him, at moments when he has fancied himself alone
with his Maker, adopt so gay and chivalrous a bearing, and
represent his own part with so much warmth and conscience, that
the illusion became catching, and I believed implicitly in the
Great Creature&rsquo;s pose.</p>
<p>But, alas! life cannot be entirely conducted on these
principles; man cannot live by Almavivery alone; and the Great
Creature, having failed upon several theatres, was obliged to
step down every evening from his heights, and sing from
half-a-dozen to a dozen comic songs, twang a guitar, keep a
country audience in good humour, and preside finally over the
mysteries of a tombola.</p>
<p>Madame Berthelini, who was art and part with him in these
undignified labours, had perhaps a higher position in the scale
of beings, and enjoyed a natural dignity of her own.&nbsp; But
her heart was not any more rightly placed, for that would have
been impossible; and she had acquired a little air of melancholy,
attractive enough in its way, but not good to see like the
wholesome, sky-scraping, boyish spirits of her lord.</p>
<p>He, indeed, swam like a kite on a fair wind, high above
earthly troubles.&nbsp; Detonations of temper were not unfrequent
in the zones he travelled; but sulky fogs and tearful depressions
were there alike unknown.&nbsp; A well-delivered blow upon a
table, or a noble attitude, imitated from M&eacute;lingne or
Frederic, relieved his irritation like a vengeance.&nbsp; Though
the heaven had fallen, if he had played his part with propriety,
Berthelini had been content!&nbsp; And the man&rsquo;s
atmosphere, if not his example, reacted on his wife; for the
couple doated on each other, and although you would have thought
they walked in different worlds, yet continued to walk hand in
hand.</p>
<p>It chanced one day that Monsieur and Madame Berthelini
descended with two boxes and a guitar in a fat case at the
station of the little town of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis, and the
omnibus carried them with their effects to the Hotel of the Black
Head.&nbsp; This was a dismal, conventual building in a narrow
street, capable of standing siege when once the gates were shut,
and smelling strangely in the interior of straw and chocolate and
old feminine apparel.&nbsp; Berthelini paused upon the threshold
with a painful premonition.&nbsp; In some former state, it seemed
to him, he had visited a hostelry that smelt not otherwise, and
been ill received.</p>
<p>The landlord, a tragic person in a large felt hat, rose from a
business table under the key-rack, and came forward, removing his
hat with both hands as he did so.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir, I salute you.&nbsp; May I inquire what is your
charge for artists?&rdquo; inquired Berthelini, with a courtesy
at once splendid and insinuating.</p>
<p>&ldquo;For artists?&rdquo; said the landlord.&nbsp; His
countenance fell and the smile of welcome disappeared.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, artists!&rdquo; he added brutally; &ldquo;four francs
a day.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he turned his back upon these
inconsiderable customers.</p>
<p>A commercial traveller is received, he also, upon a
reduction&mdash;yet is he welcome, yet can he command the fatted
calf; but an artist, had he the manners of an Almaviva, were he
dressed like Solomon in all his glory, is received like a dog and
served like a timid lady travelling alone.</p>
<p>Accustomed as he was to the rubs of his profession, Berthelini
was unpleasantly affected by the landlord&rsquo;s manner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elvira,&rdquo; said he to his wife, &ldquo;mark my
words: Castel-le-G&acirc;chis is a tragic folly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait till we see what we take,&rdquo; replied
Elvira.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We shall take nothing,&rdquo; returned Berthelini;
&ldquo;we shall feed upon insults.&nbsp; I have an eye, Elvira: I
have a spirit of divination; and this place is accursed.&nbsp;
The landlord has been discourteous, the Commissary will be
brutal, the audience will be sordid and uproarious, and you will
take a cold upon your throat.&nbsp; We have been besotted enough
to come; the die is cast&mdash;it will be a second
S&eacute;dan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>S&eacute;dan was a town hateful to the Berthelinis, not only
from patriotism (for they were French, and answered after the
flesh to the somewhat homely name of Duval), but because it had
been the scene of their most sad reverses.&nbsp; In that place
they had lain three weeks in pawn for their hotel bill, and had
it not been for a surprising stroke of fortune they might have
been lying there in pawn until this day.&nbsp; To mention the
name of S&eacute;dan was for the Berthelinis to dip the brush in
earthquake and eclipse.&nbsp; Count Almaviva slouched his hat
with a gesture expressive of despair, and even Elvira felt as if
ill-fortune had been personally invoked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us ask for breakfast,&rdquo; said she, with a
woman&rsquo;s tact.</p>
<p>The Commissary of Police of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis was a large
red Commissary, pimpled, and subject to a strong cutaneous
transpiration.&nbsp; I have repeated the name of his office
because he was so very much more a Commissary than a man.&nbsp;
The spirit of his dignity had entered into him.&nbsp; He carried
his corporation as if it were something official.&nbsp; Whenever
he insulted a common citizen it seemed to him as if he were
adroitly flattering the Government by a side wind; in default of
dignity he was brutal from an overweening sense of duty.&nbsp;
His office was a den, whence passers-by could hear rude accents
laying down, not the law, but the good pleasure of the
Commissary.</p>
<p>Six several times in the course of the day did M. Berthelini
hurry thither in quest of the requisite permission for his
evening&rsquo;s entertainment; six several times he found the
official was abroad.&nbsp; L&eacute;on Berthelini began to grow
quite a familiar figure in the streets of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis;
he became a local celebrity, and was pointed out as &ldquo;the
man who was looking for the Commissary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Idle
children attached themselves to his footsteps, and trotted after
him back and forward between the hotel and the office.&nbsp;
L&eacute;on might try as he liked; he might roll cigarettes, he
might straddle, he might cock his hat at a dozen different jaunty
inclinations&mdash;the part of Almaviva was, under the
circumstances, difficult to play.</p>
<p>As he passed the market-place upon the seventh excursion the
Commissary was pointed out to him, where he stood, with his
waistcoat unbuttoned and his hands behind his back, to
superintend the sale and measurement of butter.&nbsp; Berthelini
threaded his way through the market stalls and baskets, and
accosted the dignitary with a bow which was a triumph of the
histrionic art.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the honour,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;of meeting
M. le Commissaire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Commissary was affected by the nobility of his
address.&nbsp; He excelled L&eacute;on in the depth if not in the
airy grace of his salutation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The honour,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;is mine!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; continued the strolling-player, &ldquo;I
am, sir, an artist, and I have permitted myself to interrupt you
on an affair of business.&nbsp; To-night I give a trifling
musical entertainment at the Caf&eacute; of the Triumphs of the
Plough&mdash;permit me to offer you this little
programme&mdash;and I have come to ask you for the necessary
authorisation.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At the word &ldquo;artist,&rdquo; the Commissary had replaced
his hat with the air of a person who, having condescended too
far, should suddenly remember the duties of his rank.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go, go,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I am busy&mdash;I am
measuring butter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Heathen Jew!&rdquo; thought L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Permit me, sir,&rdquo; he resumed aloud.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
have gone six times already&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Put up your bills if you choose,&rdquo; interrupted the
Commissary.&nbsp; &ldquo;In an hour or so I will examine your
papers at the office.&nbsp; But now go; I am busy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Measuring butter!&rdquo; thought Berthelini.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Oh, France, and it is for this that we made
&rsquo;93!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The preparations were soon made; the bills posted, programmes
laid on the dinner-table of every hotel in the town, and a stage
erected at one end of the Caf&eacute; of the Triumphs of the
Plough; but when L&eacute;on returned to the office, the
Commissary was once more abroad.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is like Madame Beno&icirc;ton,&rdquo; thought
L&eacute;on, &ldquo;Fichu Commissaire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And just then he met the man face to face.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, sir,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;are my papers.&nbsp;
Will you be pleased to verify?&rdquo;</p>
<p>But the Commissary was now intent upon dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No use,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;no use; I am busy; I
am quite satisfied.&nbsp; Give your entertainment.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he hurried on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fichu Commissaire!&rdquo; thought L&eacute;on.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER II</h3>
<p>The audience was pretty large; and the proprietor of the
caf&eacute; made a good thing of it in beer.&nbsp; But the
Berthelinis exerted themselves in vain.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on was radiant in velveteen; he had a rakish way of
smoking a cigarette between his songs that was worth money in
itself; he underlined his comic points, so that the dullest
numskull in Castel-le-G&acirc;chis had a notion when to laugh;
and he handled his guitar in a manner worthy of himself.&nbsp;
Indeed his play with that instrument was as good as a whole
romantic drama; it was so dashing, so florid, and so
cavalier.</p>
<p>Elvira, on the other hand, sang her patriotic and romantic
songs with more than usual expression; her voice had charm and
plangency; and as L&eacute;on looked at her, in her low-bodied
maroon dress, with her arms bare to the shoulder, and a red
flower set provocatively in her corset, he repeated to himself
for the many hundredth time that she was one of the loveliest
creatures in the world of women.</p>
<p>Alas! when she went round with the tambourine, the golden
youth of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis turned from her coldly.&nbsp;
Here and there a single halfpenny was forthcoming; the net result
of a collection never exceeded half a franc; and the Maire
himself, after seven different applications, had contributed
exactly twopence.&nbsp; A certain chill began to settle upon the
artists themselves; it seemed as if they were singing to slugs;
Apollo himself might have lost heart with such an audience.&nbsp;
The Berthelinis struggled against the impression; they put their
back into their work, they sang loud and louder, the guitar
twanged like a living thing; and at last L&eacute;on arose in his
might, and burst with inimitable conviction into his great song,
&ldquo;Y a des honn&ecirc;tes gens partout!&rdquo;&nbsp; Never
had he given more proof of his artistic mastery; it was his
intimate, indefeasible conviction that Castel-le-G&acirc;chis
formed an exception to the law he was now lyrically proclaiming,
and was peopled exclusively by thieves and bullies; and yet, as I
say, he flung it down like a challenge, he trolled it forth like
an article of faith; and his face so beamed the while that you
would have thought he must make converts of the benches.</p>
<p>He was at the top of his register, with his head thrown back
and his mouth open, when the door was thrown violently open, and
a pair of new comers marched noisily into the caf&eacute;.&nbsp;
It was the Commissary, followed by the Garde Champ&ecirc;tre.</p>
<p>The undaunted Berthelini still continued to proclaim, &ldquo;Y
a des honn&ecirc;tes gens partout!&rdquo;&nbsp; But now the
sentiment produced an audible titter among the audience.&nbsp;
Berthelini wondered why; he did not know the antecedents of the
Garde Champ&ecirc;tre; he had never heard of a little story about
postage stamps.&nbsp; But the public knew all about the postage
stamps and enjoyed the coincidence hugely.</p>
<p>The Commissary planted himself upon a vacant chair with
somewhat the air of Cromwell visiting the Rump, and spoke in
occasional whispers to the Garde Champ&ecirc;tre, who remained
respectfully standing at his back.&nbsp; The eyes of both were
directed upon Berthelini, who persisted in his statement.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Y a des honn&ecirc;tes gens partout,&rdquo; he was just
chanting for the twentieth time; when up got the Commissary upon
his feet and waved brutally to the singer with his cane.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is it me you want?&rdquo; inquired L&eacute;on,
stopping in his song.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is you,&rdquo; replied the potentate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Fichu Commissaire!&rdquo; thought L&eacute;on, and he
descended from the stage and made his way to the functionary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How does it happen, sir,&rdquo; said the Commissary,
swelling in person, &ldquo;that I find you mountebanking in a
public caf&eacute; without my permission?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Without?&rdquo; cried the indignant L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Permit me to remind you&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come, come, sir!&rdquo; said the Commissary, &ldquo;I
desire no explanations.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I care nothing about what you desire,&rdquo; returned
the singer.&nbsp; &ldquo;I choose to give them, and I will not be
gagged.&nbsp; I am an artist, sir, a distinction that you cannot
comprehend.&nbsp; I received your permission and stand here upon
the strength of it; interfere with me who dare.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have not got my signature, I tell you,&rdquo; cried
the Commissary.&nbsp; &ldquo;Show me my signature!&nbsp; Where is
my signature?&rdquo;</p>
<p>That was just the question; where was his signature?&nbsp;
L&eacute;on recognised that he was in a hole; but his spirit rose
with the occasion, and he blustered nobly, tossing back his
curls.&nbsp; The Commissary played up to him in the character of
tyrant; and as the one leaned farther forward, the other leaned
farther back&mdash;majesty confronting fury.&nbsp; The audience
had transferred their attention to this new performance, and
listened with that silent gravity common to all Frenchmen in the
neighbourhood of the Police.&nbsp; Elvira had sat down, she was
used to these distractions, and it was rather melancholy than
fear that now oppressed her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Another word,&rdquo; cried the Commissary, &ldquo;and I
arrest you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Arrest me?&rdquo; shouted L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
defy you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am the Commissary of Police,&rdquo; said the
official.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on commanded his feelings, and replied, with great
delicacy of innuendo&mdash;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So it would appear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The point was too refined for Castel-le-G&acirc;chis; it did
not raise a smile; and as for the Commissary, he simply bade the
singer follow him to his office, and directed his proud footsteps
towards the door.&nbsp; There was nothing for it but to
obey.&nbsp; L&eacute;on did so with a proper pantomime of
indifference, but it was a leek to eat, and there was no denying
it.</p>
<p>The Maire had slipped out and was already waiting at the
Commissary&rsquo;s door.&nbsp; Now the Maire, in France, is the
refuge of the oppressed.&nbsp; He stands between his people and
the boisterous rigours of the Police.&nbsp; He can sometimes
understand what is said to him; he is not always puffed up beyond
measure by his dignity.&nbsp; &rsquo;Tis a thing worth the
knowledge of travellers.&nbsp; When all seems over, and a man has
made up his mind to injustice, he has still, like the heroes of
romance, a little bugle at his belt whereon to blow; and the
Maire, a comfortable <i>deus ex machin&acirc;</i>, may still
descend to deliver him from the minions of the law.&nbsp; The
Maire of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis, although inaccessible to the
charms of music as retailed by the Berthelinis, had no hesitation
whatever as to the rights of the matter.&nbsp; He instantly fell
foul of the Commissary in very high terms, and the Commissary,
pricked by this humiliation, accepted battle on the point of
fact.&nbsp; The argument lasted some little while with varying
success, until at length victory inclined so plainly to the
Commissary&rsquo;s side that the Maire was fain to reassert
himself by an exercise of authority.&nbsp; He had been
out-argued, but he was still the Maire.&nbsp; And so, turning
from his interlocutor, he briefly but kindly recommended
L&eacute;on to get back instanter to his concert.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is already growing late,&rdquo; he added.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on did not wait to be told twice.&nbsp; He returned
to the Caf&eacute; of the Triumphs of the Plough with all
expedition.&nbsp; Alas! the audience had melted away during his
absence; Elvira was sitting in a very disconsolate attitude on
the guitar-box; she had watched the company dispersing by twos
and threes, and the prolonged spectacle had somewhat overwhelmed
her spirits.&nbsp; Each man, she reflected, retired with a
certain proportion of her earnings in his pocket, and she saw
to-night&rsquo;s board and to-morrow&rsquo;s railway expenses,
and finally even to-morrow&rsquo;s dinner, walk one after another
out of the caf&eacute; door and disappear into the night.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What was it?&rdquo; she asked languidly.&nbsp; But
L&eacute;on did not answer.&nbsp; He was looking round him on the
scene of defeat.&nbsp; Scarce a score of listeners remained, and
these of the least promising sort.&nbsp; The minute hand of the
clock was already climbing upward towards eleven.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a lost battle,&rdquo; said he, and then
taking up the money-box he turned it out.&nbsp; &ldquo;Three
francs seventy-five!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;as against four of
board and six of railway fares; and no time for the
tombola!&nbsp; Elvira, this is Waterloo.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he sat
down and passed both hands desperately among his curls. &ldquo;O
Fichu Commissaire!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;Fichu
Commissaire!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get the things together and be off,&rdquo;
returned Elvira.&nbsp; &ldquo;We might try another song, but
there is not six halfpence in the room.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Six halfpence?&rdquo; cried L&eacute;on, &ldquo;six
hundred thousand devils!&nbsp; There is not a human creature in
the town&mdash;nothing but pigs and dogs and commissaires!&nbsp;
Pray heaven, we get safe to bed.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t imagine things!&rdquo; exclaimed Elvira,
with a shudder.</p>
<p>And with that they set to work on their preparations.&nbsp;
The tobacco-jar, the cigarette-holder, the three papers of
shirt-studs, which were to have been the prices of the tombola
had the tombola come off, were made into a bundle with the music;
the guitar was stowed into the fat guitar-case; and Elvira having
thrown a thin shawl about her neck and shoulders, the pair issued
from the caf&eacute; and set off for the Black Head.</p>
<p>As they crossed the market-place the church bell rang out
eleven.&nbsp; It was a dark, mild night, and there was no one in
the streets.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is all very fine,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on;
&ldquo;but I have a presentiment.&nbsp; The night is not yet
done.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER III</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> &ldquo;Black Head&rdquo;
presented not a single chink of light upon the street, and the
carriage gate was closed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is unprecedented,&rdquo; observed
L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;An inn closed by five minutes after
eleven!&nbsp; And there were several commercial travellers in the
caf&eacute; up to a late hour.&nbsp; Elvira, my heart misgives
me.&nbsp; Let us ring the bell.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The bell had a potent note; and being swung under the arch it
filled the house from top to bottom with surly, clanging
reverberations.&nbsp; The sound accentuated the conventual
appearance of the building; a wintry sentiment, a thought of
prayer and mortification, took hold upon Elvira&rsquo;s mind;
and, as for L&eacute;on, he seemed to be reading the stage
directions for a lugubrious fifth act.</p>
<p>&ldquo;This is your fault,&rdquo; said Elvira: &ldquo;this is
what comes of fancying things!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Again L&eacute;on pulled the bell-rope; again the solemn
tocsin awoke the echoes of the inn; and ere they had died away, a
light glimmered in the carriage entrance, and a powerful voice
was heard upraised and tremulous with wrath.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s all this?&rdquo; cried the tragic host
through the spars of the gate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hard upon twelve, and
you come clamouring like Prussians at the door of a respectable
hotel?&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; he cried, &ldquo;I know you now!&nbsp;
Common singers!&nbsp; People in trouble with the police!&nbsp;
And you present yourselves at midnight like lords and
ladies?&nbsp; Be off with you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will permit me to remind you,&rdquo; replied
L&eacute;on, in thrilling tones, &ldquo;that I am a guest in your
house, that I am properly inscribed, and that I have deposited
baggage to the value of four hundred francs.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You cannot get in at this hour,&rdquo; returned the
man.&nbsp; &ldquo;This is no thieves&rsquo; tavern, for mohocks
and night rakes and organ-grinders.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brute!&rdquo; cried Elvira, for the organ-grinders
touched her home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then I demand my baggage,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, with
unabated dignity.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know nothing of your baggage,&rdquo; replied the
landlord.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You detain my baggage?&nbsp; You dare to detain my
baggage?&rdquo; cried the singer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; returned the landlord.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is dark&mdash;I cannot recognise you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well, then&mdash;you detain my baggage,&rdquo;
concluded L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You shall smart for
this.&nbsp; I will weary out your life with persecutions; I will
drag you from court to court; if there is justice to be had in
France, it shall be rendered between you and me.&nbsp; And I will
make you a by-word&mdash;I will put you in a song&mdash;a
scurrilous song&mdash;an indecent song&mdash;a popular
song&mdash;which the boys shall sing to you in the street, and
come and howl through these spars at midnight!&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had gone on raising his voice at every phrase, for all the
while the landlord was very placidly retiring; and now, when the
last glimmer of light had vanished from the arch, and the last
footstep died away in the interior, L&eacute;on turned to his
wife with a heroic countenance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Elvira,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I have now a duty in
life.&nbsp; I shall destroy that man as Eug&egrave;ne Sue
destroyed the concierge.&nbsp; Let us come at once to the
Gendarmerie and begin our vengeance.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He picked up the guitar-case, which had been propped against
the wall, and they set forth through the silent and ill-lighted
town with burning hearts.</p>
<p>The Gendarmerie was concealed beside the telegraph office at
the bottom of a vast court, which was partly laid out in gardens;
and here all the shepherds of the public lay locked in grateful
sleep.&nbsp; It took a deal of knocking to waken one; and he,
when he came at last to the door, could find no other remark but
that &ldquo;it was none of his business.&rdquo;&nbsp; L&eacute;on
reasoned with him, threatened him, besought him;
&ldquo;here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;was Madame Berthelini in
evening dress&mdash;a delicate woman&mdash;in an interesting
condition&rdquo;&mdash;the last was thrown in, I fancy, for
effect; and to all this the man-at-arms made the same answer:</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is none of my business,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;then we
shall go to the Commissary.&rdquo;&nbsp; Thither they went; the
office was closed and dark; but the house was close by, and
L&eacute;on was soon swinging the bell like a madman.&nbsp; The
Commissary&rsquo;s wife appeared at a window.&nbsp; She was a
thread-paper creature, and informed them that the Commissary had
not yet come home.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Is he at the Maire&rsquo;s?&rdquo; demanded
L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>She thought that was not unlikely.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where is the Maire&rsquo;s house?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>And she gave him some rather vague information on that
point.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Stay you here, Elvira,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on,
&ldquo;lest I should miss him by the way.&nbsp; If, when I
return, I find you here no longer, I shall follow at once to the
Black Head.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he set out to find the Maire&rsquo;s.&nbsp; It took him
some ten minutes wandering among blind lanes, and when he arrived
it was already half-an-hour past midnight.&nbsp; A long white
garden wall overhung by some thick chestnuts, a door with a
letter-box, and an iron bell-pull, that was all that could be
seen of the Maire&rsquo;s domicile.&nbsp; L&eacute;on took the
bell-pull in both hands, and danced furiously upon the
side-walk.&nbsp; The bell itself was just upon the other side of
the wall, it responded to his activity, and scattered an alarming
clangour far and wide into the night.</p>
<p>A window was thrown open in a house across the street, and a
voice inquired the cause of this untimely uproar.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish the Maire,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has been in bed this hour,&rdquo; returned the
voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He must get up again,&rdquo; retorted L&eacute;on, and
he was for tackling the bell-pull once more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You will never make him hear,&rdquo; responded the
voice.&nbsp; &ldquo;The garden is of great extent, the house is
at the farther end, and both the Maire and his housekeeper are
deaf.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, pausing.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
Maire is deaf, is he?&nbsp; That explains.&rdquo;&nbsp; And he
thought of the evening&rsquo;s concert with a momentary feeling
of relief.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and so
the Maire is deaf, and the garden vast, and the house at the far
end?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And you might ring all night,&rdquo; added the voice,
&ldquo;and be none the better for it.&nbsp; You would only keep
me awake.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you, neighbour,&rdquo; replied the singer.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You shall sleep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And he made off again at his best pace for the
Commissary&rsquo;s.&nbsp; Elvira was still walking to and fro
before the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He has not come?&rdquo; asked L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not he,&rdquo; she replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; returned L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am
sure our man&rsquo;s inside.&nbsp; Let me see the
guitar-case.&nbsp; I shall lay this siege in form, Elvira; I am
angry; I am indignant; I am truculently inclined; but I thank my
Maker I have still a sense of fun.&nbsp; The unjust judge shall
be importuned in a serenade, Elvira.&nbsp; Set him up&mdash;and
set him up.&rdquo;</p>
<p>He had the case opened by this time, struck a few chords, and
fell into an attitude which was irresistibly Spanish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;feel your voice.&nbsp;
Are you ready?&nbsp; Follow me!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The guitar twanged, and the two voices upraised, in harmony
and with a startling loudness, the chorus of a song of old
B&eacute;ranger&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Commissaire! Commissaire!<br />
Colin bat sa m&eacute;nag&egrave;re.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The stones of Castel-le-G&acirc;chis thrilled at this
audacious innovation.&nbsp; Hitherto had the night been sacred to
repose and nightcaps; and now what was this?&nbsp; Window after
window was opened; matches scratched, and candles began to
flicker; swollen sleepy faces peered forth into the
starlight.&nbsp; There were the two figures before the
Commissary&rsquo;s house, each bolt upright, with head thrown
back and eyes interrogating the starry heavens; the guitar
wailed, shouted, and reverberated like half an orchestra; and the
voices, with a crisp and spirited delivery, hurled the
appropriate burden at the Commissary&rsquo;s window.&nbsp; All
the echoes repeated the functionary&rsquo;s name.&nbsp; It was
more like an entr&rsquo;acte in a farce of Moli&egrave;re&rsquo;s
than a passage of real life in Castel-le-G&acirc;chis.</p>
<p>The Commissary, if he was not the first, was not the last of
the neighbours to yield to the influence of music, and furiously
throw open the window of his bedroom.&nbsp; He was beside himself
with rage.&nbsp; He leaned far over the window-sill, raying and
gesticulating; the tassel of his white night-cap danced like a
thing of life: he opened his mouth to dimensions hitherto
unprecedented, and yet his voice, instead of escaping from it in
a roar, came forth shrill and choked and tottering.&nbsp; A
little more serenading, and it was clear he would be better
acquainted with the apoplexy.</p>
<p>I scorn to reproduce his language; he touched upon too many
serious topics by the way for a quiet story-teller.&nbsp;
Although he was known for a man who was prompt with his tongue,
and had a power of strong expression at command, he excelled
himself so remarkably this night that one maiden lady, who had
got out of bed like the rest to hear the serenade, was obliged to
shut her window at the second clause.&nbsp; Even what she had
heard disquieted her conscience; and next day she said she
scarcely reckoned as a maiden lady any longer.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on tried to explain his predicament, but he received
nothing but threats of arrest by way of answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I come down to you!&rdquo; cried the Commissary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aye,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;do!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will not!&rdquo; cried the Commissary.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You dare not!&rdquo; answered L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>At that the Commissary closed his window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All is over,&rdquo; said the singer.&nbsp; &ldquo;The
serenade was perhaps ill-judged.&nbsp; These boors have no sense
of humour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us get away from here,&rdquo; said Elvira, with a
shiver.&nbsp; &ldquo;All these people looking&mdash;it is so rude
and so brutal.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then giving way once more to
passion&mdash;&ldquo;Brutes!&rdquo; she cried aloud to the
candle-lit spectators&mdash;&ldquo;brutes! brutes!
brutes!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sauve qui peut,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;You have done it now!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And taking the guitar in one hand and the case in the other,
he led the way with something too precipitate to be merely called
precipitation from the scene of this absurd adventure.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER IV</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">To</span> the west of
Castel-le-G&acirc;chis four rows of venerable lime-trees formed,
in this starry night, a twilit avenue with two side aisles of
pitch darkness.&nbsp; Here and there stone benches were disposed
between the trunks.&nbsp; There was not a breath of wind; a heavy
atmosphere of perfume hung about the alleys; and every leaf stood
stock-still upon its twig.&nbsp; Hither, after vainly knocking at
an inn or two, the Berthelinis came at length to pass the
night.&nbsp; After an amiable contention, L&eacute;on insisted on
giving his coat to Elvira, and they sat down together on the
first bench in silence.&nbsp; L&eacute;on made a cigarette, which
he smoked to an end, looking up into the trees, and, beyond them,
at the constellations, of which he tried vainly to recall the
names.&nbsp; The silence was broken by the church bell; it rang
the four quarters on a light and tinkling measure; then followed
a single deep stroke that died slowly away with a thrill; and
stillness resumed its empire.</p>
<p>&ldquo;One,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Four hours
till daylight.&nbsp; It is warm; it is starry; I have matches and
tobacco.&nbsp; Do not let us exaggerate, Elvira&mdash;the
experience is positively charming.&nbsp; I feel a glow within me;
I am born again.&nbsp; This is the poetry of life.&nbsp; Think of
Cooper&rsquo;s novels, my dear.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;on,&rdquo; she said fiercely, &ldquo;how can
you talk such wicked, infamous nonsense?&nbsp; To pass all night
out-of-doors&mdash;it is like a nightmare!&nbsp; We shall
die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You suffer yourself to be led away,&rdquo; he replied
soothingly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is not unpleasant here; only you
brood.&nbsp; Come, now, let us repeat a scene.&nbsp; Shall we try
Alceste and C&eacute;lim&egrave;ne?&nbsp; No?&nbsp; Or a passage
from the &lsquo;Two Orphans&rsquo;?&nbsp; Come, now, it will
occupy your mind; I will play up to you as I never have played
before; I feel art moving in my bones.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hold your tongue,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;or you will
drive me mad!&nbsp; Will nothing solemnise you&mdash;not even
this hideous situation?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, hideous!&rdquo; objected L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Hideous is not the word.&nbsp; Why, where would you
be?&nbsp; &lsquo;Dites, la jeune belle, o&ugrave; voulez-vous
aller?&rsquo;&rdquo; he carolled.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, now,&rdquo;
he went on, opening the guitar-case, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s another
idea for you&mdash;sing.&nbsp; Sing &lsquo;Dites, la jeune
belle!&rsquo;&nbsp; It will compose your spirits, Elvira, I am
sure.&rdquo;</p>
<p>And without waiting an answer he began to strum the
symphony.&nbsp; The first chords awoke a young man who was lying
asleep upon a neighbouring bench.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; cried the young man, &ldquo;who are
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Under which king, Bezonian?&rdquo; declaimed the
artist.&nbsp; &ldquo;Speak or die!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Or if it was not exactly that, it was something to much the
same purpose from a French tragedy.</p>
<p>The young man drew near in the twilight.&nbsp; He was a tall,
powerful, gentlemanly fellow, with a somewhat puffy face, dressed
in a grey tweed suit, with a deer-stalker hat of the same
material; and as he now came forward he carried a knapsack slung
upon one arm.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you camping out here too?&rdquo; he asked, with a
strong English accent.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sorry for
company.&rdquo;</p>
<p>L&eacute;on explained their misadventure; and the other told
them that he was a Cambridge undergraduate on a walking tour,
that he had run short of money, could no longer pay for his
night&rsquo;s lodging, had already been camping out for two
nights, and feared he should require to continue the same
man&oelig;uvre for at least two nights more.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Luckily, it&rsquo;s jolly weather,&rdquo; he
concluded.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that, Elvira,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Madame Berthelini,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;is
ridiculously affected by this trifling occurrence.&nbsp; For my
part, I find it romantic and far from uncomfortable; or at
least,&rdquo; he added, shifting on the stone bench, &ldquo;not
quite so uncomfortable as might have been expected.&nbsp; But
pray be seated.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the undergraduate, sitting down,
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s rather nice than otherwise when once
you&rsquo;re used to it; only it&rsquo;s devilish difficult to
get washed.&nbsp; I like the fresh air and these stars and
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Aha!&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;Monsieur is an
artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;An artist?&rdquo; returned the other, with a blank
stare.&nbsp; &ldquo;Not if I know it!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me,&rdquo; said the actor.&nbsp; &ldquo;What you
said this moment about the orbs of heaven&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, nonsense!&rdquo; cried the Englishman.&nbsp;
&ldquo;A fellow may admire the stars and be anything he
likes.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You have an artist&rsquo;s nature, however, Mr.&mdash;I
beg your pardon; may I, without indiscretion, inquire your
name?&rdquo; asked L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My name is Stubbs,&rdquo; replied the Englishman.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thank you,&rdquo; returned L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Mine is Berthelini&mdash;L&eacute;on Berthelini, ex-artist
of the theatres of Montrouge, Belleville, and Montmartre.&nbsp;
Humble as you see me, I have created with applause more than one
important <i>r&ocirc;le</i>.&nbsp; The Press were unanimous in
praise of my Howling Devil of the Mountains, in the piece of the
same name.&nbsp; Madame, whom I now present to you, is herself an
artist, and I must not omit to state, a better artist than her
husband.&nbsp; She also is a creator; she created nearly twenty
successful songs at one of the principal Parisian
music-halls.&nbsp; But, to continue, I was saying you had an
artist&rsquo;s nature, Monsieur Stubbs, and you must permit me to
be a judge in such a question.&nbsp; I trust you will not falsify
your instincts; let me beseech you to follow the career of an
artist.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned Stubbs, with a
chuckle.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to be a banker.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;do not say
so.&nbsp; Not that.&nbsp; A man with such a nature as yours
should not derogate so far.&nbsp; What are a few privations here
and there, so long as you are working for a high and noble
goal?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;This fellow&rsquo;s mad,&rdquo; thought Stubbs;
&ldquo;but the woman&rsquo;s rather pretty, and he&rsquo;s not
bad fun himself, if you come to that.&rdquo;&nbsp; What he said
was different.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought you said you were an
actor?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I certainly did so,&rdquo; replied L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I am one, or, alas!&nbsp; I was.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you want me to be an actor, do you?&rdquo;
continued the undergraduate.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why, man, I could never
so much as learn the stuff; my memory&rsquo;s like a sieve; and
as for acting, I&rsquo;ve no more idea than a cat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The stage is not the only course,&rdquo; said
L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;Be a sculptor, be a dancer, be a poet
or a novelist; follow your heart, in short, and do some thorough
work before you die.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you call all these things <i>art</i>?&rdquo;
inquired Stubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, certainly!&rdquo; returned L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Are they not all branches?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&nbsp; I didn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; replied the
Englishman.&nbsp; &ldquo;I thought an artist meant a fellow who
painted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The singer stared at him in some surprise.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is the difference of language,&rdquo; he said at
last.&nbsp; &ldquo;This Tower of Babel, when shall we have paid
for it?&nbsp; If I could speak English you would follow me more
readily.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Between you and me, I don&rsquo;t believe I
should,&rdquo; replied the other.&nbsp; &ldquo;You seem to have
thought a devil of a lot about this business.&nbsp; For my part,
I admire the stars, and like to have them
shining&mdash;it&rsquo;s so cheery&mdash;but hang me if I had an
idea it had anything to do with art!&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not in my
line, you see.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not intellectual; I have no end of
trouble to scrape through my exams., I can tell you!&nbsp; But
I&rsquo;m not a bad sort at bottom,&rdquo; he added, seeing his
interlocutor looked distressed even in the dim starshine,
&ldquo;and I rather like the play, and music, and guitars, and
things.&rdquo;</p>
<p>L&eacute;on had a perception that the understanding was
incomplete.&nbsp; He changed the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And so you travel on foot?&rdquo; he continued.&nbsp;
&ldquo;How romantic!&nbsp; How courageous!&nbsp; And how are you
pleased with my land?&nbsp; How does the scenery affect you among
these wild hills of ours?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, the fact is,&rdquo; began Stubbs&mdash;he was
about to say that he didn&rsquo;t care for scenery, which was not
at all true, being, on the contrary, only an athletic
undergraduate pretension; but he had begun to suspect that
Berthelini liked a different sort of meat, and substituted
something else&mdash;&ldquo;The fact is, I think it jolly.&nbsp;
They told me it was no good up here; even the guide-book said so;
but I don&rsquo;t know what they meant.&nbsp; I think it is
deuced pretty&mdash;upon my word, I do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this moment, in the most unexpected manner, Elvira burst
into tears.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My voice!&rdquo; she cried.&nbsp; &ldquo;L&eacute;on,
if I stay here longer I shall lose my voice!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You shall not stay another moment,&rdquo; cried the
actor.&nbsp; &ldquo;If I have to beat in a door, if I have to
burn the town, I shall find you shelter.&rdquo;</p>
<p>With that he replaced the guitar, and comforting her with some
caresses, drew her arm through his.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur Stubbs,&rdquo; said he, taking of his hat,
&ldquo;the reception I offer you is rather problematical; but let
me beseech you to give us the pleasure of your society.&nbsp; You
are a little embarrassed for the moment; you must, indeed, permit
me to advance what may be necessary.&nbsp; I ask it as a favour;
we must not part so soon after having met so
strangely.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, come, you know,&rdquo; said Stubbs, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t let a fellow like you&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And there
he paused, feeling somehow or other on a wrong tack.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I do not wish to employ menaces,&rdquo; continued
L&eacute;on, with a smile; &ldquo;but if you refuse, indeed I
shall not take it kindly.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite see my way out of it,&rdquo;
thought the undergraduate; and then, after a pause, he said,
aloud and ungraciously enough, &ldquo;All right.&nbsp;
I&mdash;I&rsquo;m very much obliged, of course.&rdquo;&nbsp; And
he proceeded to follow them, thinking in his heart, &ldquo;But
it&rsquo;s bad form, all the same, to force an obligation on a
fellow.&rdquo;</p>
<h3>CHAPTER V</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">L&eacute;on</span> strode ahead as if he
knew exactly where he was going; the sobs of Madame were still
faintly audible, and no one uttered a word.&nbsp; A dog barked
furiously in a courtyard as they went by; then the church clock
struck two, and many domestic clocks followed or preceded it in
piping tones.&nbsp; And just then Berthelini spied a light.&nbsp;
It burned in a small house on the outskirts of the town, and
thither the party now directed their steps.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is always a chance,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>The house in question stood back from the street behind an
open space, part garden, part turnip-field; and several outhouses
stood forward from either wing at right angles to the
front.&nbsp; One of these had recently undergone some
change.&nbsp; An enormous window, looking towards the north, had
been effected in the wall and roof, and L&eacute;on began to hope
it was a studio.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If it&rsquo;s only a painter,&rdquo; he said with a
chuckle, &ldquo;ten to one we get as good a welcome as we
want.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I thought painters were principally poor,&rdquo; said
Stubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; cried L&eacute;on, &ldquo;you do not know
the world as I do.&nbsp; The poorer the better for us!&rdquo;</p>
<p>And the trio advanced into the turnip-field.</p>
<p>The light was in the ground floor; as one window was brightly
illuminated and two others more faintly, it might be supposed
that there was a single lamp in one corner of a large apartment;
and a certain tremulousness and temporary dwindling showed that a
live fire contributed to the effect.&nbsp; The sound of a voice
now became audible; and the trespassers paused to listen.&nbsp;
It was pitched in a high, angry key, but had still a good, full,
and masculine note in it.&nbsp; The utterance was voluble, too
voluble even to be quite distinct; a stream of words, rising and
falling, with ever and again a phrase thrown out by itself, as if
the speaker reckoned on its virtue.</p>
<p>Suddenly another voice joined in.&nbsp; This time it was a
woman&rsquo;s; and if the man were angry, the woman was incensed
to the degree of fury.&nbsp; There was that absolutely blank
composure known to suffering males; that colourless unnatural
speech which shows a spirit accurately balanced between homicide
and hysterics; the tone in which the best of women sometimes
utter words worse than death to those most dear to them.&nbsp; If
Abstract Bones-and-Sepulchre were to be endowed with the gift of
speech, thus, and not otherwise, would it discourse.&nbsp;
L&eacute;on was a brave man, and I fear he was somewhat
sceptically given (he had been educated in a Papistical country),
but the habit of childhood prevailed, and he crossed himself
devoutly.&nbsp; He had met several women in his career.&nbsp; It
was obvious that his instinct had not deceived him, for the male
voice broke forth instantly in a towering passion.</p>
<p>The undergraduate, who had not understood the significance of
the woman&rsquo;s contribution, pricked up his ears at the change
upon the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s going to be a free fight,&rdquo; he
opined.</p>
<p>There was another retort from the woman, still calm but a
little higher.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hysterics?&rdquo; asked L&eacute;on of his wife.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Is that the stage direction?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; returned Elvira, somewhat
tartly.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, woman, woman!&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, beginning to
open the guitar-case.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is one of the burdens of my
life, Monsieur Stubbs; they support each other; they always
pretend there is no system; they say it&rsquo;s nature.&nbsp;
Even Madame Berthelini, who is a dramatic artist!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are heartless, L&eacute;on,&rdquo; said Elvira;
&ldquo;that woman is in trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And the man, my angel?&rdquo; inquired Berthelini,
passing the ribbon of his guitar.&nbsp; &ldquo;And the man,
<i>m&rsquo;amour</i>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is a man,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You hear that?&rdquo; said L&eacute;on to Stubbs.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It is not too late for you.&nbsp; Mark the
intonation.&nbsp; And now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;what are
we to give them?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you going to sing?&rdquo; asked Stubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am a troubadour,&rdquo; replied L&eacute;on.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I claim a welcome by and for my art.&nbsp; If I were a
banker could I do as much?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, you wouldn&rsquo;t need, you know,&rdquo;
answered the undergraduate.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Egad,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;but that&rsquo;s
true.&nbsp; Elvira, that is true.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Of course it is,&rdquo; she replied.&nbsp; &ldquo;Did
you not know it?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; answered L&eacute;on impressively,
&ldquo;I know nothing but what is agreeable.&nbsp; Even my
knowledge of life is a work of art superiorly composed.&nbsp; But
what are we to give them?&nbsp; It should be something
appropriate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Visions of &ldquo;Let dogs delight&rdquo; passed through the
undergraduate&rsquo;s mind; but it occurred to him that the
poetry was English and that he did not know the air.&nbsp; Hence
he contributed no suggestion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Something about our houselessness,&rdquo; said
Elvira.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have it,&rdquo; cried L&eacute;on.&nbsp; And he broke
forth into a song of Pierre Dupont&rsquo;s:&mdash;</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Savez-vous o&ugrave; gite,<br />
Mai, ce joli mois?&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Elvira joined in; so did Stubbs, with a good ear and voice,
but an imperfect acquaintance with the music.&nbsp; L&eacute;on
and the guitar were equal to the situation.&nbsp; The actor
dispensed his throat-notes with prodigality and enthusiasm; and,
as he looked up to heaven in his heroic way, tossing the black
ringlets, it seemed to him that the very stars contributed a dumb
applause to his efforts, and the universe lent him its silence
for a chorus.&nbsp; That is one of the best features of the
heavenly bodies, that they belong to everybody in particular; and
a man like L&eacute;on, a chronic Endymion who managed to get
along without encouragement, is always the world&rsquo;s centre
for himself.</p>
<p>He alone&mdash;and it is to be noted, he was the worst singer
of the three&mdash;took the music seriously to heart, and judged
the serenade from a high artistic point of view.&nbsp; Elvira, on
the other hand, was preoccupied about their reception; and, as
for Stubbs, he considered the whole affair in the light of a
broad joke.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Know you the lair of May, the lovely month?&rdquo; went
the three voices in the turnip-field.</p>
<p>The inhabitants were plainly fluttered; the light moved to and
fro, strengthening in one window, paling in another; and then the
door was thrown open, and a man in a blouse appeared on the
threshold carrying a lamp.&nbsp; He was a powerful young fellow,
with bewildered hair and beard, wearing his neck open; his blouse
was stained with oil-colours in a harlequinesque disorder; and
there was something rural in the droop and bagginess of his
belted trousers.</p>
<p>From immediately behind him, and indeed over his shoulder, a
woman&rsquo;s face looked out into the darkness; it was pale and
a little weary, although still young; it wore a dwindling,
disappearing prettiness, soon to be quite gone, and the
expression was both gentle and sour, and reminded one faintly of
the taste of certain drugs.&nbsp; For all that, it was not a face
to dislike; when the prettiness had vanished, it seemed as if a
certain pale beauty might step in to take its place; and as both
the mildness and the asperity were characters of youth, it might
be hoped that, with years, both would merge into a constant,
brave, and not unkindly temper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; cried the man.</p>
<h3>CHAPTER VI</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">L&eacute;on</span> had his hat in his hand
at once.&nbsp; He came forward with his customary grace; it was a
moment which would have earned him a round of cheering on the
stage.&nbsp; Elvira and Stubbs advanced behind him, like a couple
of Admetus&rsquo;s sheep following the god Apollo.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on, &ldquo;the hour is
unpardonably late, and our little serenade has the air of an
impertinence.&nbsp; Believe me, sir, it is an appeal.&nbsp;
Monsieur is an artist, I perceive.&nbsp; We are here three
artists benighted and without shelter, one a woman&mdash;a
delicate woman&mdash;in evening dress&mdash;in an interesting
situation.&nbsp; This will not fail to touch the woman&rsquo;s
heart of Madame, whom I perceive indistinctly behind Monsieur her
husband, and whose face speaks eloquently of a well-regulated
mind.&nbsp; Ah! Monsieur, Madame&mdash;one generous movement, and
you make three people happy!&nbsp; Two or three hours beside your
fire&mdash;I ask it of Monsieur in the name of Art&mdash;I ask it
of Madame by the sanctity of womanhood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The two, as by a tacit consent, drew back from the door.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; said the man.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Entrez, Madame,&rdquo; said the woman.</p>
<p>The door opened directly upon the kitchen of the house, which
was to all appearance the only sitting-room.&nbsp; The furniture
was both plain and scanty; but there were one or two landscapes
on the wall handsomely framed, as if they had already visited the
committee-rooms of an exhibition and been thence extruded.&nbsp;
L&eacute;on walked up to the pictures and represented the part of
a connoisseur before each in turn, with his usual dramatic
insight and force.&nbsp; The master of the house, as if
irresistibly attracted, followed him from canvas to canvas with
the lamp.&nbsp; Elvira was led directly to the fire, where she
proceeded to warm herself, while Stubbs stood in the middle of
the floor and followed the proceedings of L&eacute;on with mild
astonishment in his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should see them by daylight,&rdquo; said the
artist.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I promise myself that pleasure,&rdquo; said
L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;You possess, sir, if you will permit me
an observation, the art of composition to a T.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are very good,&rdquo; returned the other.&nbsp;
&ldquo;But should you not draw nearer to the fire?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;With all my heart,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on.</p>
<p>And the whole party was soon gathered at the table over a
hasty and not an elegant cold supper, washed down with the least
of small wines.&nbsp; Nobody liked the meal, but nobody
complained; they put a good face upon it, one and all, and made a
great clattering of knives and forks.&nbsp; To see L&eacute;on
eating a single cold sausage was to see a triumph; by the time he
had done he had got through as much pantomime as would have
sufficed for a baron of beef, and he had the relaxed expression
of the over-eaten.</p>
<p>As Elvira had naturally taken a place by the side of
L&eacute;on, and Stubbs as naturally, although I believe
unconsciously, by the side of Elvira, the host and hostess were
left together.&nbsp; Yet it was to be noted that they never
addressed a word to each other, nor so much as suffered their
eyes to meet.&nbsp; The interrupted skirmish still survived in
ill-feeling; and the instant the guests departed it would break
forth again as bitterly as ever.&nbsp; The talk wandered from
this to that subject&mdash;for with one accord the party had
declared it was too late to go to bed; but those two never
relaxed towards each other; Goneril and Regan in a sisterly tiff
were not more bent on enmity.</p>
<p>It chanced that Elvira was so much tired by all the little
excitements of the night, that for once she laid aside her
company manners, which were both easy and correct, and in the
most natural manner in the world leaned her head on
L&eacute;on&rsquo;s shoulder.&nbsp; At the same time, fatigue
suggesting tenderness, she locked the fingers of her right hand
into those of her husband&rsquo;s left; and, half closing her
eyes, dozed off into a golden borderland between sleep and
waking.&nbsp; But all the time she was not aware of what was
passing, and saw the painter&rsquo;s wife studying her with looks
between contempt and envy.</p>
<p>It occurred to L&eacute;on that his constitution demanded the
use of some tobacco; and he undid his fingers from Elvira&rsquo;s
in order to roll a cigarette.&nbsp; It was gently done, and he
took care that his indulgence should in no other way disturb his
wife&rsquo;s position.&nbsp; But it seemed to catch the eye of
the painter&rsquo;s wife with a special significancy.&nbsp; She
looked straight before her for an instant, and then, with a swift
and stealthy movement, took hold of her husband&rsquo;s hand
below the table.&nbsp; Alas! she might have spared herself the
dexterity.&nbsp; For the poor fellow was so overcome by this
caress that he stopped with his mouth open in the middle of a
word, and by the expression of his face plainly declared to all
the company that his thoughts had been diverted into softer
channels.</p>
<p>If it had not been rather amiable, it would have been absurdly
droll.&nbsp; His wife at once withdrew her touch; but it was
plain she had to exert some force.&nbsp; Thereupon the young man
coloured and looked for a moment beautiful.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on and Elvira both observed the byplay, and a shock
passed from one to the other; for they were inveterate
match-makers, especially between those who were already
married.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said L&eacute;on
suddenly.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see no use in pretending.&nbsp; Before
we came in here we heard sounds indicating&mdash;if I may so
express myself&mdash;an imperfect harmony.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Sir&mdash;&rdquo; began the man.</p>
<p>But the woman was beforehand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is quite true,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I see
no cause to be ashamed.&nbsp; If my husband is mad I shall at
least do my utmost to prevent the consequences.&nbsp; Picture to
yourself, Monsieur and Madame,&rdquo; she went on, for she passed
Stubbs over, &ldquo;that this wretched person&mdash;a dauber, an
incompetent, not fit to be a sign-painter&mdash;receives this
morning an admirable offer from an uncle&mdash;an uncle of my
own, my mother&rsquo;s brother, and tenderly beloved&mdash;of a
clerkship with nearly a hundred and fifty pounds a year, and that
he&mdash;picture to yourself!&mdash;he refuses it!&nbsp;
Why?&nbsp; For the sake of Art, he says.&nbsp; Look at his art, I
say&mdash;look at it!&nbsp; Is it fit to be seen?&nbsp; Ask
him&mdash;is it fit to be sold?&nbsp; And it is for this,
Monsieur and Madame, that he condemns me to the most deplorable
existence, without luxuries, without comforts, in a vile suburb
of a country town.&nbsp; O non!&rdquo; she cried,
&ldquo;non&mdash;je ne me tairai pas&mdash;c&rsquo;est plus fort
que moi!&nbsp; I take these gentlemen and this lady for
judges&mdash;is this kind? is it decent? is it manly?&nbsp; Do I
not deserve better at his hands after having married him
and&rdquo;&mdash;(a visible hitch)&mdash;&ldquo;done everything
in the world to please him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I doubt if there were ever a more embarrassed company at a
table; every one looked like a fool; and the husband like the
biggest.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The art of Monsieur, however,&rdquo; said Elvira,
breaking the silence, &ldquo;is not wanting in
distinction.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has this distinction,&rdquo; said the wife,
&ldquo;that nobody will buy it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have supposed a clerkship&mdash;&rdquo; began
Stubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art is Art,&rdquo; swept in L&eacute;on.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
salute Art.&nbsp; It is the beautiful, the divine; it is the
spirit of the world, and the pride of life.&nbsp;
But&mdash;&rdquo;&nbsp; And the actor paused.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A clerkship&mdash;&rdquo; began Stubbs.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is,&rdquo; said the
painter.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am an artist, and as this gentleman says,
Art is this and the other; but of course, if my wife is going to
make my life a piece of perdition all day long, I prefer to go
and drown myself out of hand.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go!&rdquo; said his wife.&nbsp; &ldquo;I should like to
see you!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was going to say,&rdquo; resumed Stubbs, &ldquo;that
a fellow may be a clerk and paint almost as much as he
likes.&nbsp; I know a fellow in a bank who makes capital
water-colour sketches; he even sold one for
seven-and-six.&rdquo;</p>
<p>To both the women this seemed a plank of safety; each
hopefully interrogated the countenance of her lord; even Elvira,
an artist herself!&mdash;but indeed there must be something
permanently mercantile in the female nature.&nbsp; The two men
exchanged a glance; it was tragic; not otherwise might two
philosophers salute, as at the end of a laborious life each
recognised that he was still a mystery to his disciples.</p>
<p>L&eacute;on arose.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Art is Art,&rdquo; he repeated sadly.&nbsp; &ldquo;It
is not water-colour sketches, nor practising on a piano.&nbsp; It
is a life to be lived.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And in the meantime people starve!&rdquo; observed the
woman of the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;If that&rsquo;s a life, it is
not one for me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rdquo; burst forth
L&eacute;on; &ldquo;you, Madame, go into another room and talk it
over with my wife; and I&rsquo;ll stay here and talk it over with
your husband.&nbsp; It may come to nothing, but let&rsquo;s
try.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am very willing,&rdquo; replied the young woman; and
she proceeded to light a candle.&nbsp; &ldquo;This way if you
please.&rdquo;&nbsp; And she led Elvira upstairs into a
bedroom.&nbsp; &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; said she, sitting down,
&ldquo;that my husband cannot paint.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No more can mine act,&rdquo; replied Elvira.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should have thought he could,&rdquo; returned the
other; &ldquo;he seems clever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He is so, and the best of men besides,&rdquo; said
Elvira; &ldquo;but he cannot act.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least he is not a sheer humbug like mine; he can at
least sing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You mistake L&eacute;on,&rdquo; returned his wife
warmly.&nbsp; &ldquo;He does not even pretend to sing; he has too
fine a taste; he does so for a living.&nbsp; And, believe me,
neither of the men are humbugs.&nbsp; They are people with a
mission&mdash;which they cannot carry out.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Humbug or not,&rdquo; replied the other, &ldquo;you
came very near passing the night in the fields; and, for my part,
I live in terror of starvation.&nbsp; I should think it was a
man&rsquo;s mission to think twice about his wife.&nbsp; But it
appears not.&nbsp; Nothing is their mission but to play the
fool.&nbsp; Oh!&rdquo; she broke out, &ldquo;is it not something
dreary to think of that man of mine?&nbsp; If he could only do
it, who would care?&nbsp; But no&mdash;not he&mdash;no more than
I can!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Have you any children?&rdquo; asked Elvira.</p>
<p>&ldquo;No; but then I may.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Children change so much,&rdquo; said Elvira, with a
sigh.</p>
<p>And just then from the room below there flew up a sudden
snapping chord on the guitar; one followed after another; then
the voice of L&eacute;on joined in; and there was an air being
played and sung that stopped the speech of the two women.&nbsp;
The wife of the painter stood like a person transfixed; Elvira,
looking into her eyes, could see all manner of beautiful memories
and kind thoughts that were passing in and out of her soul with
every note; it was a piece of her youth that went before her; a
green French plain, the smell of apple-flowers, the far and
shining ringlets of a river, and the words and presence of
love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;L&eacute;on has hit the nail,&rdquo; thought Elvira to
herself.&nbsp; &ldquo;I wonder how.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The how was plain enough.&nbsp; L&eacute;on had asked the
painter if there were no air connected with courtship and
pleasant times; and having learnt what he wished, and allowed an
interval to pass, he had soared forth into</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;O mon amante,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; O mon d&eacute;sir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Sachons cueillir<br />
L&rsquo;heure charmante!&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Pardon me, Madame,&rdquo; said the painter&rsquo;s
wife, &ldquo;your husband sings admirably well.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He sings that with some feeling,&rdquo; replied Elvira,
critically, although she was a little moved herself, for the song
cut both ways in the upper chamber; &ldquo;but it is as an actor
and not as a musician.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Life is very sad,&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;it so
wastes away under one&rsquo;s fingers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have not found it so,&rdquo; replied Elvira.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I think the good parts of it last and grow greater every
day.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, how would you advise me?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Frankly, I would let my husband do what he
wished.&nbsp; He is obviously a very loving painter; you have not
yet tried him as a clerk.&nbsp; And you know&mdash;if it were

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
